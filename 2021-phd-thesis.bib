abstract = {Multiagent control provides strategies for aggregating microscopic robots ("nanorobots") in fluid environments relevant for medical applications. Unlike larger robots, viscous forces and Brownian motion dominate the behavior. Examples range from modified microorganisms (programmable bacteria) to future robots using ongoing developments in molecular computation, sensors and motors. We evaluate controls for locating a cell-sized area emitting a chemical into a moving fluid with parameters corresponding to chemicals released in response to injury or infection in small blood vessels. These control methods are passive Brownian motion, following the chemical concentration gradient, and cooperative behaviors in which some robots use acoustic signals to guide others to the chemical source. Control performance is evaluated using diffusion equations to describe the robot motions and control state transitions. The quantitative results show these control techniques are feasible approaches to the task with trade-offs among fabrication difficulty, response speed, false positive detection rate and energy use. Controlled aggregation at chemically distinctive locations could be useful for sensitive diagnosis, selective changes to biological tissues and forming structures using previous proposals for multiagent control of modular robots. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.},

Models of cooperation are discussed and related to the input/output reachability, structural observability, and controllability of the entire system. Whereas decentralized control research in the past has concentrated on using decentralized controllers to partition complex physically interconnected systems, this work uses decentralized methods to connect otherwise independent nontouching robotic vehicles so that they behave in a stable, coordinated fashion. A vector Liapunov method is used to prove stability of two examples: the controlled motion of multiple vehicles along a line and the controlled motion of multiple vehicles in formation. Also presented are three applications of this theory: controlling a formation, guarding a perimeter, and surrounding a facility.},

Different from other swarm intelligence studies, swarm robotics puts emphases on the physical embodiment of individuals and realistic interactions among the individuals and between the individuals and the environment. In this chapter, we present a brief review of this new approach. We first present its definition, discuss the main motivations behind the approach, as well as its distinguishing characteristics and major coordination mechanisms. Then we present a brief review of swarm robotics research along four axes; namely design, modelling and analysis, robots and problems.},

abstract = {A flexible, low cost, and portable indoor navigational aid for persons who are blind or have severe visual impairments remains an unmet need and a technical challenge. Whereas devices using global positioning system (GPS) signals hold promise for navigational assistance in the outdoor environment, they do not work where GPS signals are absent or greatly attenuated. Thus a network of navigational beacons is needed for the indoor environment. This paper describes the promise of an indoor navigational aid that relies on a network of custom extended-range RFID tags. RFID (radio-frequency identification) technology has the advantages of being low cost, unobtrusive, and highly flexible in the sense that sight impaired travelers can use personalized RFID tags to mark indoor locations of their particular interest. However, commercially available RFID tags have very short detection ranges. To make them suitable as indoor electronic beacons, their range of detection must be greatly extended. Some of the technical challenges and proposed solutions that can extend the detection range are discussed in this paper following an overview of the proposed RFID based indoor navigational aid.},

abstract = {A lack-of-fit test can be used to determine whether a finite element (FE) material model, or experimental results should be the focus to improve overall model accuracy. The lack-of-fit test compares the unbiased estimate of variance to the estimated variance from noise within data. GSJ and Hart methods from literature are provided to estimate the noise within data, and a generalized lack-of-fit test is described. The variance estimators are compared and convergence is demonstrated on a simple regression problem. The lack-of-fit test is then applied to a material calibration problem using the FE method. The lack-of-fit test indicates that the shear component of a non-linear orthotropic material models could be improved, despite already being considered an excellent fit. Additionally the lack-of-fit test is used with a load-dependent Poisson's ratio to demonstrate that the variance in the experimental data should be reduced in order to improve the model.},

Based on some assumptions, we built the idealized models of the basic search problem and three kinds of environmental restrictions. In our previous works, we have raised two searching strategies (GES and IGES) inspired from firework explosion and three restriction-handling strategies, and in this paper, we describe and analyze these strategies systematically. A series of experiments were carried out, and the results show that the strategies proposed work well on the idealized models. And it's valuable to note that, compared to GES and RPSO, IGES was more efficient and showed greater stability in searching process, greater adaptiveness in both small and large scale problems and greater compatibility with restriction-handling strategies.},

abstract = {Swarm robotics is a decentralized control architecture, where global behavior emerges as a result of local interactions between neighboring robots. The deficiency of the swarm behavior model is the stochastic nature of movement patterns, which reduces its applicability, when precise maneuvering is needed. This paper alleviates this problem by introducing fuzzy manual control of a multi-robot system utilizing the swarm behavior model. The built-in swarm behavior controls low level tasks such as formation keeping and obstacle avoidance. A fuzzy controller works as an intelligent mechanism for tuning the manual control signal received by the robots. The main advantages of the presented algorithm are: 1) deliberating the operator from low level maneuvering tasks; 2) single operator control of multi-robot group; 3) robustness, flexibility and scalability. The presented architecture was implemented and tested in a simulation environment. The introduced system can significantly improve the performance of search and rescue operations as well as exploration of dangerous environments.},

We used Breve {\&}{\#}x2212;3D Environment for the Simulation of Decentralized Systems- to build our simulation. Since many factors can affect the ideal number of agents, we studied selected important factors which we believe have the highest effects on the final result like task time, area, cost and map's capacity.

abstract = {There is a belief that complexity and chaos are essential for adaptability. But life deals with complexity every moment, without the chaos that engineers fear so, by invoking goal-directed behaviour. Goals can be programmed. That is why living organisms give us hope to achieve adaptability in robots. In this paper a method for the description of a goal-directed, or programmed, behaviour, interacting with uncertainty of environment, is described. We suggest reducing the structural (goals, intentions) and stochastic components (probability to realise the goal) of individual behaviour to random variables with nominal values to apply probabilistic approach. This allowed us to use a Normalized Entropy Index to detect the system state by estimating the contribution of each agent to the group behaviour. The number of possible group states is 27. We argue that adaptation has a limited number of possible paths between these 27 states. Paths and states can be programmed so that after adjustment to any particular case of task and conditions, adaptability will never involve chaos. We suggest the application of the model to operation of robots or other devices in remote and/or dangerous places.},

abstract = {As research expands in multiagent intelligent systems, investigators need new tools for evaluating the artificial societies they study. It is impossible, for example, to correlate heterogeneity with performance in multiagent robotics without a quantitative metric of diversity. Currently diversity is evaluated on a bipolar scale with systems classified as either heterogeneous or homogeneous, depending on whether any of the agents differ. Unfortunately, this labeling doesn't tell us much about the extent of diversity in heterogeneous teams. How can it be determined if one system is more or less diverse than another? Heterogeneity must be evaluated on a continuous scale to enable substantive comparisons between systems. To enable these types of comparisons, we introduce: (1) a continuous measure of robot behavioral difference, and (2) hierarchic social entropy, an application of Shannon's information entropy metric to robotic groups that provides a continuous, quantitative measure of robot team diversity. The metric captures important components of the meaning of diversity, including the number and size of behavioral groups in a society and the extent to which agents differ. The utility of the metrics is demonstrated in the experimental evaluation of multirobot soccer and multirobot foraging teams.},

abstract = {Methods of general applicability are searched for in swarm intelligence with the aim of gaining new insights about natural swarms and to develop design methodologies for artificial swarms. An ideal solution could be a 'swarm calculus' that allows to calculate key features of swarms such as expected swarm performance and robustness based on only a few parameters. To work towards this ideal, one needs to find methods and models with high degrees of generality. In this paper, we report two models that might be examples of exceptional generality. First, an abstract model is presented that describes swarm performance depending on swarm density based on the dichotomy between cooperation and interference. Typical swarm experiments are given as examples to show how the model fits to several different results. Second, we give an abstract model of collective decision making that is inspired by urn models. The effects of positive-feedback probability, that is increasing over time in a decision making system, are understood by the help of a parameter that controls the feedback based on the swarm's current consensus. Several applicable methods, such as the description as Markov process, calculation of splitting probabilities, mean first passage times, and measurements of positive feedback, are discussed and applications to artificial and natural swarms are reported.},

abstract = {We propose an auction algorithm to allocate tasks that have temporal constraints to cooperative robots. Temporal constraints are expressed as time windows, within which a task must be executed. There are no restrictions on the time windows, which are allowed to overlap. Robots model their tem- poral constraints using a simple temporal network, enabling them to maintain consistent schedules. When bidding on a task, a robot takes into account its own current commitments and an optimization objective, which is to minimize the time of completion of the last task alone or in combination with minimizing the distance traveled. The algorithm works both when all the tasks are known upfront and when tasks arrive dynamically. We show the performance of the algorithm in simulation with different numbers of tasks and robots, and compare it with a baseline greedy algorithm and a state-of- the-art auction algorithm. Our algorithm is computationally frugal and consistently allocates more tasks than the compet- ing algorithms. Introduction},

Our algorithm utilizes an iterated auction scheme, in which a batch of tasks that are pairwise unconstrained is selected in each iteration and scheduled using a modified sequential single-item auction. This algorithm also gains flexibility by allowing the use of task prioritization to order the scheduling process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this iterated auction scheme empirically using existing 100- and 1000-task data sets that we have modified to include precedence constraints.},

abstract = {Deploying large numbers of mobile robots which can interact with each other produces swarm intelligent behavior. However, mobile robots are normally running with finite energy resource, supplied from finite battery. The limitation of energy resource required human intervention for recharging the batteries. The sharing information among the mobile robots would be one of the potentials to overcome the limitation on previously recharging system. A new approach is proposed based on integrated intelligent system inspired by foraging of honeybees applied to multimobile robot scenario. This integrated approach caters for both working and foraging stages for known/unknown power station locations. Swarm mobile robot inspired by honeybee is simulated to explore and identify the power station for battery recharging. The mobile robots will share the location information of the power station with each other. The result showed that mobile robots consume less energy and less time when they are cooperating with each other for foraging process. The optimizing of foraging behavior would result in the mobile robots spending more time to do real work.},

To address this problem, a bio-inspired swarm intelligence based algorithm is proposed for a distributed multi-robot system to combine explorative searching and dynamic task allocation together for collective construction. Basically, a virtual pheromone trail based method is proposed as the message passing mechanism among the robots, where robots make distributed movement decisions through local interactions. Since blocks may need multiple robots to work together, dynamic task allocation among robots is necessary. A modified Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method is proposed to balance the exploration and exploitation, which helps to allocate reasonable robots to different target blocks.

abstract = {We examined the occurrence, mechanism and costs and benefits of leaf caching in laboratory colonies of two species of leafcutting ants, Atta cephalotes and A. colombica. If foragers returning to the nest are unable to enter because of a temporary bottleneck caused by leaves building up they may deposit their leaf pieces outside the nest entrance, forming a leaf cache. Similar leaf caches occur in the field at foraging trail junctions, obstacles on the trail and within nest entrance tunnels. Foraging ants carrying leaves were presented with different-sized leaf caches and the number dropping their leaves on the cache was recorded. The probability of a forager dropping her leaf was positively correlated with the size of the cache that she encountered. Therefore, positive feedback played a role in the formation of nest entrance caches. Cached pieces were more likely to be retrieved than noncached pieces but the time taken to retrieve leaf pieces from a cache was greater than from scattered groups of leaves. We suggest that the strategy of flexible nest entrance caching is an adaptive response to fluctuating food availability and collection.},

Important research issues regarding communication concern what should be communicated, over what range, and when the communication should occur. We also consider how diverse behaviors might help or hinder a team, and how to measure diversity in the first place. Finally, we show how learning can provide a powerful means for enabling a team to master a task or adapt to changing conditions. We hypothesize that these three topics are critically interrelated in the con-text of learning swarms, and we suggest research directions to explore them. 1 Overview What is the relationship between communication, learning, and diversity in the context of robot swarms? We know already that different types of learning can impact the behavioral diversity of a learning robot team [1]. We also know that communication can improve robot team performance significantly. But commu-nication adds cost and complexity to a robot system [2]. In spite of a substantial volume of work in each of these areas, there has been little, or no research that ties all three areas together. The focus of this paper is to review fundamental research concerning robot teams in the areas of communication, diversity and learning. We hypothesize that robotic swarms will depend critically on research in each of these domains, and that successful systems will leverage results from each area. In fact, we suggest that it will be essential to consider all three issues at once. We propose new research directions that will serve to bring these domains together in the context of robot swarms. The research we review here was primarily conducted with small teams of robots (from one to eight) and in simulation. These limitations were due pri-marily to experimental resource constraints that were present in the 1990s, but are largely absent in the 2000s: reliable robots are much less expensive now. We expect that the results from this earlier work will apply to swarms as well as they apply to teams.},

abstract = {Using the biologically inspired notion of 'virtual pheromone' we describe how a robot swarm can become a distributed computing mesh embedded within the environment, while simultaneously acting as a physical embodiment of the user interface. By virtue of this simple peer-to-peer messaging scheme, many coordinated activities can be ac-complished without centralized control. 1 Vision We envision a robotic system where the system itself is not a single robot or even a team of robots, but rather, a superorganism of many small and sim-ple autonomous elements acting together as a unified whole. The challenge in realizing such a system lies in developing a suitable medium for interaction be-tween elements and in deriving the appropriate modes of information exchange such that large-scale complex coordinated actions can occur from the cumula-tive effects of many simple local interactions. This paper describes a biologically inspired concept for such an interaction medium and a software infrastructure for controlling the local information exchange between elements. Imagine a future scenario in which a rescue team enters an unfamiliar building after a disaster, and needs to quickly locate survivors. A rescue worker opens a jar containing thousands of microscopic MEMS-based robots [9] and tosses them into the room. Interacting only locally with their neighbors, these robots use attraction/repulsion behaviors to quickly disperse into the open spaces. A robot, upon detecting a survivor, emits a message signaling the discovery. This message is relayed locally between neighboring robots, propagating only along unobstructed paths, producing a " virtual pheromone " gradient as it is propa-gated as illustrated in Figure 1. Ultimately, the message makes its way back to the entrance where rescue team members can now follow the gradient to the survivor. To do this, the robots themselves serve as a distributed display of guideposts leading the way along the shortest unobstructed path. Ultimately, swarms of small-scale robots should be able to achieve large-scale results in tasks such as surveillance, reconnaissance, hazard detection, path find-ing, payload conveyance, and small-scale actuation [9]. The challenges to reach-ing this goal lie as much in the technology for controlling and coordinating the},

abstract = {This review paper sets out to explore the question of how future complex engineered systems based upon the swarm intelligence paradigm could be assured for dependability. The paper introduces the new concept of 'swarm engineering': a fusion of dependable systems en-gineering and swarm intelligence. The paper reviews the disciplines and processes conventionally employed to assure the dependability of con-ventional complex (and safety critical) systems in the light of swarm intelligence research and in so doing tries to map processes of analy-sis, design and test for safety-critical systems against relevant research in swarm intelligence. A case study of a swarm robotic system is used to illustrate this mapping. The paper concludes that while some of the tools needed to assure a swarm for dependability exist, many do not, and hence much work needs to be done before dependable swarms become a reality. 1 Vision From an engineering standpoint the design of complex distributed systems based upon swarm intelligence is compellingly attractive but problematical. A distinguishing characteristic of distributed systems based upon swarm intelligence is that they have no hierarchical command and control structure, and hence no common mode failure point or vulnerability. Typically, individual agents make decisions autonomously, based upon local sensing and communications [5, 6]. Systems with these characteristics could, potentially, exhibit very high levels of robustness, in the sense of tolerance to failure of individual agents; much higher levels of robustness than in complex distributed systems based on traditional design approaches. However, that robustness comes at a price. Complex systems with swarm intelligence might be very difficult to control or mediate if they started to exhibit unexpected behaviours. Such systems would therefore need to be designed and validated for a high level of assurance that they exhibit intended behaviours and equally importantly do not exhibit unintended behaviours. It seems reasonable to assert that future engineered systems based on the swarm intelligence paradigm would need to be subject to processes of design, analysis and test no less demanding that those we expect for current complex systems.},

Al-though the behavior of an individual robot in a swarm is often characterized by an important stochastic component, the collective behavior of swarms is statistically predictable and has often a simple probabilistic description. Indeed, we show that a class of mathematical models that describe the dynamics of collective behavior can be generated using the individual robot controller as modeling blueprint. We illustrate the macroscopic modelling methods with the help of a few sample results gathered in distributed manipulation experiments (collaborative stick pulling, foraging, aggregation). We compare the models' predictions to results of probabilistic numeric and sensor-based simulations as well as experiments with real robots. Depending on the assumptions, the metric used, and the complexity of the models, we show that it is possible to achieve quantitatively correct predictions.},

In contrast to existing robot simulators, which obtain scalability by imposing limitations to the extent and accuracy of the robot models, in ARGoS we pursue a deeply modular approach that allows the user both to add custom features easily and to allocate computational resources where needed by the experiment at hand. In this respect, a unique feature of ARGoS is the possibility to use multiple physics engines for different parts of the environment. The physics engines can be of different kinds and robots can migrate from one to another in a transparent way. This feature enables a whole new set of optimizations to improve scalability and paves the way for a new approach to parallelism in robotic simulation. Results show that ARGoS can simulate about 10,000 wheeled robots with full dynamics in real-time. We discuss possible improvements to the architecture of ARGoS to achieve simulations of millions of entities in real-time.},

We employ a sim-ple method to allocate individuals to the partitions. The approach is empirically studied both in an environment with a narrow nest area and an environment with-out this constraint.

Although the neurophysiological processes by which signals are produced, conducted, perceived, and in-terpreted are well understood, the conditions condu-cive to the evolution of communication and the paths by which reliable systems of communication become established remain largely unknown. This is a particu-larly challenging problem because efficient communi-cation requires tight coevolution between the signal emitted and the response elicited [3]. We conducted repeated trials of experimental evolution with robots that could produce visual signals to provide informa-tion on food location. We found that communication readily evolves when colonies consist of genetically similar individuals and when selection acts at the colony level. We identified several distinct communi-cation systems that differed in their efficiency. Once a given system of communication was well estab-lished, it constrained the evolution of more efficient communication systems. Under individual selection, the ability to produce visual signals resulted in the evolution of deceptive communication strategies in colonies of unrelated robots and a concomitant de-crease in colony performance. This study generates predictions about the evolutionary conditions condu-cive to the emergence of communication and provides guidelines for designing artificial evolutionary sys-tems displaying spontaneous communication.

abstract = {Division of labor has been studied separately from a proximate self-organization and an ultimate evolutionary perspective. We aim to bring together these two perspectives. So far this has been done by choosing a behavioral mechanism a priori and considering the evolution of the properties of this mechanism. Here we use artificial neural networks to allow for a more open architecture. We study whether emergent division of labor can evolve in two different network architectures; a simple feedforward network, and a more complex network that includes the possibility of self-feedback from previous experiences. We focus on two aspects of division of labor; worker specialization and the ratio of work performed for each task. Colony fitness is maximized by both reducing idleness and achieving a predefined optimal work ratio. Our results indicate that architectural constraints play an important role for the outcome of evolution. With the simplest network, only genetically determined specialization is possible. This imposes several limitations on worker specialization. Moreover, in order to minimize idleness, networks evolve a biased work ratio, even when an unbiased work ratio would be optimal. By adding self-feedback to the network we increase the network's flexibility and worker specialization evolves under a wider parameter range. Optimal work ratios are more easily achieved with the self-feedback network, but still provide a challenge when combined with worker specialization.},

This algorithm, called Swarm-GAP, is based on theoretical models of division of labor in social insect colonies. It uses a probabilistic decision model. Swarm-GAP is experimented both in a scenario from RoboCup Rescue and an abstract simulation environment.

abstract = {In the multi-foraging task studied in this paper, a group of robots has to efficiently retrieve two different types of prey to a nest. Robots have to decide when they leave the nest to forage and which prey to retrieve. The goal of this study is to identify an efficient multi-foraging behaviour, where efficiency is defined as a function of the energy that is spent by the robots during exploration and gained when a prey is retrieved to the nest. We design and validate a mathematical model that is used to predict the optimal behaviour. We introduce a decision algorithm and use simulations to study its performance in a wide range of experimental situations with respect to the predictions of the mathematical model.},

abstract = {Task partitioning is the name given to the phenomenon in which a piece of work is divided among two or more workers, such as the partitioning of the collection of a load of forage between a forager and a storer or transporter. This study 1) reviews empirical data concerning the occurrence of task partitioning in insect societies with the general aim of drawing broad conclusions about its prevalence and diversity, and 2) considers the potential costs and benefits of task partitioning. The data show that task partitioning occurs in many species, with examples in ants, bees, wasps, and termites. The general impression is that it is an important and widespread feature of work organisation in insect societies. Nearly all examples concern foraging. There is much variation on the main theme. For example, in the number of intersecting cycles (2, 3 linear, 3 all interlocking), where transfer occurs (at the nest, at the forage site, on the trail back to the nest), whether transfer is direct or indirect (liquids such as nectar, water, and honeydew are always transferred directly whereas solids are transferred both directly and indirectly). Task partitioning is always subject to time costs. Benefits occur either through enhancement of individual performance (e.g., where task partitioning permits greater division of labour thereby utilising consistent differences in worker abilities caused by morphology or experience) or through enhancement of the overall system (e.g., where partitioning itself eliminates a constraint affecting task performance, such as when a forager can collect sufficient material for several builders). By causing a series organisation of work, task partitioning reduces system reliability but this. effect may be minimal in ail but very small colonies. [References: 44] 44},

abstract = {Task partitioning is a way of organizing work consisting in the decomposition of a task into smaller sub-tasks that can be tackled separately. Task partitioning can be beneficial in terms of reduction of physical interference, increase of efficiency, higher parallelism, and ex-ploitation of specialization. However, task partitioning also entails costs in terms of coordination efforts and overheads that can reduce its bene-fits. It is therefore important to decide when to make use of task parti-tioning. In this paper we show that such a decision can be formulated as a multi-armed bandit problem. This is advantageous since the theoret-ical properties of the multi-armed bandit problem are well understood and several algorithms have been proposed for tackling it. We carry out our study in simulation, using a swarm robotics foraging scenario as a testbed. We test an ad-hoc algorithm and two algorithms proposed in the literature for multi-armed bandit problems. The results confirm that the problem of selecting whether to partition a task can be formulated as a multi-armed bandit problem and tackled with existing algorithms.},

abstract = {Traffic dynamics are often modeled by complex dynamical systems for which classical analysis tools can struggle to provide tractable policies used by transportation agencies and planners. In light of the introduction of automated vehicles into transportation systems, there is a new need for understanding the impacts of automation on transportation networks. The present article formulates and approaches the mixed-autonomy traffic control problem (where both auto-mated and human-driven vehicles are present) using the powerful framework of deep reinforcement learning (RL). The resulting policies and emergent behaviors in mixed-autonomy traffic settings provide insight for the potential for automa-tion of traffic through mixed fleets of automated and manned vehicles. Model-free learning methods are shown to naturally select policies and behaviors previ-ously designed by model-driven approaches, such as stabilization and platooning, known to improve ring road efficiency and to even exceed a theoretical velocity limit. Remarkably, RL succeeds at maximizing velocity by effectively leveraging the structure of the human driving behavior to form an efficient vehicle spacing for an intersection network. We describe our results in the context of existing control theoretic results for stability analysis and mixed-autonomy analysis. This article additionally introduces state equivalence classes to improve the sample complex-ity for the learning methods.},

We chart advances over the past several decades that address challenges of perception and action under uncertainty through the lens of computation. Advances include the development of representations and inferential procedures for large-scale probabilistic inference and machinery for enabling reflection and decisions about tradeoffs in effort, precision, and timeliness of computations. These tools are deployed toward the goal of computational rationality: identifying decisions with highest expected utility, while taking into consideration the costs of computation in complex real-world problems in which most relevant calculations can only be approximated. We highlight key concepts with examples that show the potential for interchange between computer science, cognitive science, and neuroscience.},

abstract = {In the aftermath of major disasters, first responders are typically overwhelmed with large numbers of, spatially distributed, search and rescue tasks, each with their own requirements. Moreover, responders have to operate in highly uncertain and dynamic en- vironments where new tasks may appear and hazards may be spreading across the disaster space. Hence, rescue missions may need to be re-planned as newinformation comes in, tasks are completed, or new hazards are discovered. Finding an optimal allocation of resources to complete all the tasks is a major computational challenge. In this paper, we use decision theoretic techniques to solve the task allocation problem posed by emergency response plan- ning and then deploy our solution as part of an agent-based planning tool in real-world field trials. By so doing, we are able to study the interactional issues that arise when humans are guided by an agent. Specifically, we develop an algorithm, based on a Multi-Agent Markov Decision Process representation of the task allocation problem and show that it outperforms standard baseline solutions. We then integrate the algorithm into a planning agent that re- sponds to requests for tasks from participants in a mixed-reality location-based game, called AtomicOrchid, that simulates disaster response settings in the real-world. We then run a number of trials of our planning agent and compare it against a purely human driven sys- tem. Our analysis of these trials show that human commanders adapt to the planning agent by taking on a more supervisory role and that, by providing humans with the flexibility of requesting plans from the agent, allows them to perform more tasks more efficiently than using purely human interactions to allocate tasks.We also discuss how such flexibility could lead to poor performance if left unchecked.},

We pursue the goal of long-term autonomy for indoor service mobile robots as the ability for them to be deployed indefinitely while they perform tasks in an evolving environment. The CoBots include several levels of autonomy, and in this paper we focus on their localization and navigation algorithms. We present the Corrective Gradient Refinement (CGR) algorithm, which refines the proposal distribution of the particle filter used for localization with sensor observations using analytically computed state space derivatives on a vector map. We also present the Fast Sampling Plane Filtering algorithm that extracts planar regions from depth images in real time. These planar regions are then projected onto the 2D vector map of the building, and along with the laser rangefinder observa-tions, used with CGR for localization. For navigation, we present a hierarchical planner, which computes a topological policy using a graph representation of the environment, computes motion commands based on the topological policy, and then modifies the motion commands to side-step perceived obstacles. We started logging the deployments of the CoBots one and a half years ago, and have since collected logs of the CoBots traversing more than 130 km over 1082 deployments and a total run time of 182 h, which we publish as a dataset consisting of more than 10 million laser scans. The logs show that although there have been continuous changes in the environment, the robots are robust to most of them, and there exist only a few locations where changes in the environment cause increased uncertainty in localization.},

abstract = {13.1 Introduction Imagine a cake that must be divided between a group of gluttonous children. To complicate matters, the cake is heterogeneous: two pieces of cake may differ in terms of their toppings, so the children have different preferences over the pieces (one may prefer a larger proportion of chocolate cnourls, while another may single-mindedly desire the piece with the cherry). In this chapter we discuss the surprisingly intricate problem of fairly dividing the cake — which serves as a metaphor for heterogeneous divisible resources such as land or time. The cake cutting problem has a long and storied history described, e.g., in the books by Brams and Taylor (1996) and Robertson and Webb (1998). The early research on the problem has two main themes: existence results showing that certain fairness guarantees can be achieved; and algorithmic results showing how such guarantees can be achieved. The focus of this chapter is on the latter theme, which has a more computational flavor. From a computer scientist's point of view, the cake cutting problem provides a sandbox in which we can explore the role of computational thinking in the allocation of divisible goods. Indeed, the elegant cake cutting model (Section 13.2) distills many of the issues we care about when studying divisible goods more broadly; for example, how to reason about computational complexity in the face of continuous inputs, and how to quantify the tradeoffs between individual fairness and global welfare.},

To this end, this paper presents FIRE, a trust and reputation model that integrates a number of information sources to produce a comprehensive assessment of an agent's likely performance in open systems. Specifically, FIRE incorporates interaction trust, role-based trust, witness reputation, and certified reputation to provide trust metrics in most circumstances. FIRE is empirically evaluated and is shown to help agents gain better utility (by effectively selecting appropriate interaction partners) than our benchmarks in a variety of agent populations. It is also shown that FIRE is able to effectively respond to changes that occur in an agent's environment.},

These algorithms utilize a market-based decision strategy as the mechanism for decentralized task selection and use a consensus routine based on local communication as the conflict resolution mechanism to achieve agreement on the winning bid values. Under reasonable assumptions on the scoring scheme, both of the proposed algorithms are proven to guarantee convergence to a conflict-free assignment, and it is shown that the converged solutions exhibit provable worst-case performance. It is also demonstrated that CBAA and CBBA produce conflict-free feasible solutions that are robust to both inconsistencies in the situational awareness across the fleet and variations in the communication network topology. Numerical experiments confirm superior convergence properties and performance when compared with existing auction-based task-allocation algorithms.},

abstract = {In this paper we propose GESwarm, a novel tool that$\backslash$ncan automatically synthesise collective behaviours for$\backslash$nswarms of autonomous robots through evolutionary$\backslash$nrobotics. Evolutionary robotics typically relies on$\backslash$nartificial evolution for tuning the weights of an$\backslash$nartificial neural network that is then used as$\backslash$nindividual behaviour representation. The main caveat of$\backslash$nneural networks is that they are very difficult to$\backslash$nreverse engineer, meaning that once a suitable solution$\backslash$nis found, it is very difficult to analyse, to modify,$\backslash$nand to tease apart the inherent principles that lead to$\backslash$nthe desired collective behaviour. In contrast, our$\backslash$nrepresentation is based on completely readable and$\backslash$nanalysable individual-level rules that lead to a$\backslash$ndesired collective behaviour.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe core of our method is a grammar that can generate a$\backslash$nrich variety of collective behaviours. We test GESwarm$\backslash$nby evolving a foraging strategy using a realistic swarm$\backslash$nrobotics simulator. We then systematically compare the$\backslash$nevolved collective behaviour against an hand-coded one$\backslash$nfor performance, scalability and flexibility, showing$\backslash$nthat collective behaviours evolved with GESwarm can$\backslash$noutperform the hand-coded one.},

@article{Drozd2008a,
abstract = {Insect inspired task allocation schemes have received significant attention as a way to control agents in dynamic or uncertain domains. This is largely because such mech- anisms rely on only simple definitions of agent behavior, a small amount of communication and a high-degree of fault tolerance. However, it is often difficult to conceptualize the appropriate learning and decision rules for these agents since in the case of swarm-intelligence approaches, the fo- cus is not on an individual agent's ability to optimize its be- havior, but on the resulting performance of the entire com- plex system. Although there have been successes in a vari- ety of domains in the past, many of these approaches have required considerable effort by the researcher to tailor the canonical definition to the specific problem at hand. This paper presents a generalized framework for solving multi- agent task allocation problems using the insect-inspired model. I then show that because of the inherent simplicity of the agent's design, we can automatically define these learn- ing and decision rules. A multi-robot task allocation experi- ment has been defined and performed. The results showhow these automatically-defined behaviors outperform existing manually defined behaviors. What follows is a reusable and automatic approach to developing customized insect in- spired agent behaviors for use with any dynamic task allo- cation problem.},

@article{Christensen2008a,
abstract = {In certain multi-robot systems the physical limitations of the individual robots can be overcome using self-assembly the autonomous creation of physical con- nections between individual robots to form a larger composite robotic entity. However, existing robotic systems capable of self-assembly have little or no control over the morphology of the self-assembled entities. This restricts the adaptability of such systems, since robots can carry out certain tasks more efficiently if their morphology is specialized to the task. In this paper, we extend the distributed mechanism presented in 8 that allows autonomous mobile robots to self-assemble into specific morphologies. We present a simple language, SWARMORPH-script, that allows for concise descriptions of the rules that govern the distributed morphology growth process. Local visual com- munication allows physically connected robots to send and receive strings. A string can be a rule identifier that triggers execution of predefined logic for extending a morphol- ogy. Alternatively, whole scripts can be communicated and subsequently executed on the receiving robot. On real self-propelled robots capable of self-assembly, we demon- strate how specific morphologies can be constructed, how the size of a morphology can be regulated, and how multiple morphologies can be assembled. We also show how the transmission of entire scripts gives the robots the capacity to participate in the formation of morphologies of which they had no a priori knowledge.},

abstract = {SUMMARYEvaluative techniques offer a tremendous potential for online controller design. However, when the optimization space is large and the performance metric is noisy, the overall adaptation process becomes extremely time consuming. Distributing the adaptation process reduces the required time and increases robustness to failure of individual agents. In this paper, we analyze the role of the four algorithmic parameters that determine the total evaluation time in a distributed implementation of a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. For an obstacle avoidance case study using up to eight robots, we explore in simulation the lower boundaries of these parameters and propose a set of empirical guidelines for choosing their values. We then apply these guidelines to a real robot implementation and show that it is feasible to optimize 24 control parameters per robot within 2 h, a limited amount of time determined by the robots' battery life. We also show that a hybrid simulate-and-transfer approach coupled with a noise-resistant PSO algorithm can be used to further reduce experimental time as compared to a pure real-robot implementation.},

In swarms of German cockroaches, aggregation into clusters emerges solely from local interactions between the individuals, whereas the probabilities to join or leave a cluster are a function of the cluster size. Rather than explicitly modeling the spatial distribution of robots in the environment, we propose a population dynamics model that keeps track of the number of robots in clusters of specific size. The model is able to quantitatively and qualitatively predict the dynamics observed in extensive realistic simulation. In particular, we show both by modeling and simulation that the emergence of a single aggregate requires a minimal communi- cation distance between individuals, whereas the robots remain scattered in the environment otherwise.},

Though the behavior of an individual agent can be considered to be stochastic and unpredictable, the collective behavior of such systems can have a simple probabilistic description. We show that a class of mathematical models that describe the dynamics of collective behavior of multi-agent systems can be written down from the details of the individual agent controller. The models are valid for Markov or memoryless agents, in which each agents future state depends only on its present state and not any of the past states.

While this algorithm reliably reaches optimal performance, it leads to unbounded parameter distributions. Results are improved by the introduction of a direct parameter exchange mechanism between selected high- and low-performing agents. The emerging parameter distributions are bounded and fluctuate between tight unimodal and bimodal profiles.

abstract = {This paper reports, for the first time, the computational performance of SequenceL for mesoscale simulations of large numbers of particles in a microfluidic device via the lattice-Boltzmann method. The performance of SequenceL simulations was assessed against the optimized serial and parallelized (via OpenMP directives) FORTRAN90 simulations. At present, OpenMP directives were not included in inter-particle and particle–wall repulsive (steric) interaction calculations due to difficulties that arose from inter-iteration dependencies between consecutive iterations of the do-loops. SequenceL simulations, on the other hand, relied on built-in automatic parallelism. Under these conditions, numerical simulations revealed that the parallelized FORTRAN90 outran the performance of SequenceL by a factor of 2.5 or more when the number of particles was 100 or less. SequenceL, however, outran the performance of the parallelized FORTRAN90 by a factor of 1.3 when the number of particles was 300. Our results show that when the number of particles increased by 30-fold, the computational time of SequenceL simulations increased linearly by a factor of 1.5, as compared to a 3.2-fold increase in serial and a 7.7-fold increase in parallelized FORTRAN90 simulations. Considering SequenceL's efficient built-in parallelism that led to a relatively small increase in computational time with increased number of particles, it could be a promising programming language for computationally-efficient mesoscale simulations of large numbers of particles in microfluidic experiments.},

abstract = {Abstract. In the last fifteen years, much interest has been focused on the deploy- ment of large teams of autonomous robots for applications such as environmen- tal monitoring, surveillance and reconnaissance, and automated parts inspection for manufacturing. The objective is to leverage the team's inherent redundancy to simul- taneously cover wide regions and achieve massive parallelization in task execution while remaining robust to individual failures. Despite recent successes, significant challenges remain, in part, due to the difficulties associated with managing and coor- dinating the various redundancies that exist in a large team of homogeneous agents. In this chapter, we present an ensemble approach towards the design of distributed control and communication strategies for the dynamic allocation of a team of robots to a set of tasks. This approach uses a class of stochastic hybrid systems to model the robot team dynamics as a continuous-time Markov jump process. The main advan- tage is a lower-dimensional representation of the team dynamics that is amenable to system-level analysis of the team's performance in the presence of task differ- entiation. We show how such analysis can be further used to design and optimize individual robot control policies through simulations and experimental validation.},

abstract = {This article presents a simple adaptation mechanism to automatically adjust the ratio of foragers to resters (division of labor) in a swarm of foraging robots and hence maximize the net energy income to the swarm. Three adaptation rules are introduced based on local sensing and communications. Individual robots use internal cues (successful food retrieval), environmental cues (collisions with teammates while searching for food) and social cues (team-mate success in food retrieval) to dynamically vary the time spent foraging or resting. Simulation results show that the swarm demonstrates successful adaptive emergent division of labor and robustness to environmental change (in food source density), and we observe that robots need to cooperate more when food is scarce. Furthermore, the adaptation mechanism is able to guide the swarm towards energy optimization despite the limited sensing and communication abilities of the individual robots and the simple social interaction rules. The swarm also exhibits the capacity to collectively perceive environmental changes; a capacity that can only be observed at a group level and cannot be deduced from individual robots.},

The proposed strategy is based mainly on the execution of wave algorithms. The swarm is viewed as a distributed system, wherein the communication is achieved by message passing among robot's neighborhood. Message propagation delimits the start and end of each subtask.

abstract = {Security is a critical concern around the world. In many domains from counter-terrorism to sustainability, limited security resources prevent complete security coverage at all times. Instead, these limited resources must be scheduled (or allocated or deployed), while simultaneously taking into account the impor-tance of different targets, the responses of the adversaries to the security posture, and the potential uncertainties in adversary payoffs and observations, etc. Com-putational game theory can help generate such security schedules. Indeed, casting the problem as a Stackelberg game, we have developed new algorithms that are now deployed over multiple years in multiple applications for scheduling of secu-rity resources. These applications are leading to real-world use-inspired research in the emerging research area of " security games " . The research challenges posed by these applications include scaling up security games to real-world sized prob-lems, handling multiple types of uncertainty, and dealing with bounded rationality of human adversaries.},

abstract = {For robot swarms to operate outside of the laboratory in complex real-world environments, they require the kind of error tolerance, flexibility, and scalability seen in living systems. While robot swarms are often designed to mimic some aspect of the behavior of social insects or other organisms, no systems have yet addressed all of these capabilities in a single framework. We describe a swarm robotics system that emulates ant behaviors, which govern memory, communication, and movement, as well as an evolutionary process that tailors those behaviors into foraging strategies that maximize performance under varied and complex conditions. The system evolves appropriate solutions to different environmental challenges. Solutions include the following: (1) increased communication when sensed information is reliable and resources to be collected are highly clustered, (2) less communication and more individual memory when cluster sizes are variable, and (3) greater dispersal with increasing swarm size. Analysis of the evolved behaviors reveals the importance of interactions among behaviors, and of the interdependencies between behaviors and environments. The effectiveness of interacting behaviors depends on the uncertainty of sensed information, the resource distribution, and the swarm size. Such interactions could not be manually specified, but are effectively evolved in simulation and transferred to physical robots. This work is the first to demonstrate high-level robot swarm behaviors that can be automatically tuned to produce efficient collective foraging strategies in varied and complex environments.},

It is only after experimental work has shown the practical interest of the method that researchers try to deepen their understanding of the method's functioning not only through more and more sophisticated experiments but also by means of an effort to build a theory. Tackling questions such as "how and why the method works'' is important, because finding an answer may help in improving its applicability. Ant colony optimization, which was introduced in the early 1990s as a novel technique for solving hard combinatorial optimization problems, finds itself currently at this point of its life cycle. With this article we provide a survey on theoretical results on ant colony optimization. First, we review some convergence results. Then we discuss relations between ant colony optimization algorithms and other approximate methods for optimization. Finally, we focus on some research efforts directed at gaining a deeper understanding of the behavior of ant colony optimization algorithms. Throughout the paper we identify some open questions with a certain interest of being solved in the near future. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In this paper, we demonstrate for the first time a swarm robotics system with evolved control successfully operating in a real and uncontrolled environment. We evolve neural network-based controllers in simulation for canonical swarm robotics tasks, namely homing, dispersion, clustering, and monitoring. We then assess the performance of the controllers on a real swarm of up to ten aquatic surface robots. Our results show that the evolved controllers transfer successfully to real robots and achieve a performance similar to the performance obtained in simulation. We validate that the evolved controllers display key properties of swarm intelligence-based control, namely scalability, flexibility, and robustness on the real swarm. We conclude with a proof-of-concept experiment in which the swarm performs a complete environmental monitoring task by combining multiple evolved controllers.},

We discuss the challenges involved in controlling a swarm-bot and address the problem of synthesizing controllers for the swarm-bot using artificial evolution. Specifically, we study aggregation and coordinated motion of the swarm-bot using a physics-based simulation of the system. Experiments, using a simplified simulation model of the s-bots, show that evolution can discover simple but effective controllers for both the aggregation and the 224 Dorigo et al. coordinated motion of the swarm-bot. Analysis of the evolved controllers shows that they have properties of scalability, that is, they continue to be effective for larger group sizes, and of generality, that is, they produce similar behaviors for configurations different from those they were originally evolved for. The portability of the evolved controllers to real s-bots is tested using a detailed simulation model which has been validated against the real s-bots in a companion paper in this same special issue.},

Their guiding principles are based on their biological inspiration and take the form of an emphasis on decentralized local control and communication. Earlier studies went a step further in emphasizing the use of simple reactive robots that only communicate indirectly through the environment. More recently SR studies have moved beyond these constraints to explore the use of non-reactive robots that communicate directly, and that can learn and represent their environment. There is no clear agreement in the literature about how far such extensions of the original principles could go. Should there be any limitations on the individual abilities of the robots used in SR studies? Should knowledge of the capabilities of social insects lead to constraints on the capabilities of individual robots in SR studies? There is a lack of explicit discussion of such questions, and researchers have adopted a variety of constraints for a variety of reasons. A simple taxonomy of swarm robotics is presented here with the aim of addressing and clarifying these questions. The taxonomy distinguishes subareas of SR based on the emphases and justifications for minimalism and individual simplicity.},

The communication graph of the swarm is connected, but there is no central authority for organizing it. We want to arrange them into a sorted and equally-spaced array between the robots with lowest and highest label, while maintaining a connected communication network. In this paper, we describe a distributed method to accomplish these goals, without using central control, while also keeping time, travel distance and communication cost at a minimum. We proceed in a number of stages (leader election, initial path construction, subtree contraction, geometric straightening, and distributed sorting), none of which requires a central authority, but still accomplishes best possible parallelization. The overall arraying is performed in O(n) time, O(n2) individual messages, and O(n) travel distance per robot. Implementation of the sorting and navigation use communication messages of fixed size, and are a practical solution for large populations of low-cost robots.},

abstract = {Programmability is an increasingly important barrier to the deployment of multi-robot systems, as no prior approach allows routine composition and reuse of general aggregate behaviors. The Proto spatial computing language, however, already provides this sort of aggregate behavior programming for non-mobile systems using an abstraction of the network as a continuous-space-filling device. We extend this abstraction to mobile systems and show that Proto can be applied to multi-robot systems with an actuator that turns a vector field into device motion. Proto programs operate on fields of values over an abstract device called the amorphous medium and can be joined together using functional composition. These programs are then automatically transformed for execution by individual devices, producing an approximation of the specified continuous-space behavior. We are thus able to build up a library of simple swarm behaviors, and to compose them together into highly succinct programs that predictably produce the desired complex swarm behaviors, as demonstrated in simulation and on a group of 40 iRobot SwarmBots.},

This problem is studied in the context of large swarms of simple robots which are capable of measuring only the distance to near-by robots. We present two distributed localization algorithms with different trade-offs between their computational complexity and their coordination requirements. The first algorithm does not require the robots to coordinate their motion. It relies on a non-linear least squares based strategy to allow robots to compute the relative pose of near-by robots. The second algorithm borrows tools from distributed computing theory to coordinate which robots must remain stationary and which robots are allowed to move. This coordination allows the robots to use standard trilateration techniques to compute the relative pose of near-by robots. Both algorithms are analyzed theoretically and validated through simulations.},

abstract = {This paper presents a solution to the problem of self-organized aggregation of embodied robots that requires no arithmetic computation. The robots have no memory and are equipped with one binary sensor, which informs them whether or not there is another robot in their line of sight. It is proven that the sensor needs to have a sufficiently long range; otherwise aggregation cannot be guaranteed, irrespective of the controller used. The optimal controller is found by performing a grid search over the space of all possible controllers. With this controller, robots rotate on the spot when they perceive another robot, and move backwards along a circular trajectory otherwise. This controller is proven to always aggregate two simultaneously moving robots in finite time, an upper bound for which is provided. Simulations show that the controller also aggregates at least 1000 robots into a single cluster consistently. Moreover, in 30 experiments with 40 physical e-puck robots, 98.6{\%} of the robots aggregated into one cluster. The results obtained have profound implications for the implementation of multi-robot systems at scales where conventional approaches to sensing and information processing are no longer applicable.},

We focus our attention on the algorithm of a multi-agent system called Swarm Chemistry, proposed by Sayama (Artif Life 15:105–114, 2009). In this model, a number of agents that have non-uniform kinetic properties coalesce into an excellent diversity of spatial structures and/or emergent behaviors, depending on the kinetic parameters provided. However, such bottom-up nature cannot be easily applied to the conventional and top-down design of artifacts. This paper presents a method of designing heterogeneous robotic swarms and finding solutions through a genetic algorithm. Simulation results with a few simple task examples demonstrate that the proposed framework allows us to acquire appropriate sets of kinetic parameters, i.e. recipes, creating swarm structures to perform a given task more effectively and efficiently. Such autonomous robots can be deployed for the purposes like disaster prevention, geographical survey, and subsea exploration.},

abstract = {Bio-inspired robot swarms encompass a rich space of dynamics and collective behaviors. Given some agent measurements of a swarm at a particular time instance, an important problem is the classification of the swarm behavior. This is challenging in practical scenarios where information from only a small number of agents may be available, resulting in limited agent samples for classification. Another challenge is recognizing emerging behavior: the prediction of swarm behavior prior to convergence of the attracting state. In this paper we address these challenges by modeling a swarm's collective motion as a low-dimensional linear subspace. We illustrate that for both synthetic and real data, these behaviors manifest as low-dimensional subspaces, and that these subspaces are highly discriminative. We also show that these subspaces generalize well to predicting emerging behavior, highlighting that there exists low-dimensional structure in transient agent behavior. In order to learn distinct behavior subspaces, we extend previous work on subspace estimation and identification from missing data to that of compressive measurements, where compressive measurements arise due to agent positions scattered throughout the domain. We demonstrate improvement in performance over prior works with respect to limited agent samples over a wide range of agent models and scenarios.},

abstract = {Nanorobotics is an emerging field of research in robotics technology, which may someday benefit clinical medicine by delivering both drugs and diagnostics into the human body. Potential applications of medical nanorobotics include early diagnosis of cancer, neutralisation of viruses, precise and incisionless surgery, targeted drug delivery, and monitoring and treatment of diabetes. To further study the application of nanorobotics in medicine, this paper focuses on the design of an agent-based simulation system, which is a computer simulation composed of multiple interacting intelligent agents within an environment. Agent- based modeling has been used to solve problems that are difficult for an individual agent to solve. A swarm of simulated robots that has individual skills and partial information about a medical problem can work collaboratively to develop a solution to it. We particularly want to investigate the scalability requirements of data distribution and communication techniques under different constraints at the nano scale},

abstract = {This paper presents a methodology for finding optimal control parameters as well as optimal system parame- ters for robot swarm controllers using probabilistic, population dynamic models. With distributed task allocation as a case study, we show how optimal control parameters leading to a desired steady-state task distribution for two fully-distributed algorithms can be found even if the parameters of the system are unknown. First, a reactive algorithm in which robots change states independently from each other and which leads to a linear macroscopic model describing the dynamics of the system is considered. Second, a threshold-based algorithm where robots change states based on the number of other robots in this state and which leads to a non-linear model is investigated. Whereas analytical results can be obtained for the linear system, the opti- mization of the non-linear controller is performed numerically. Finally, we show using stochastic simulations that whereas the presented methodology and models work best if the swarm size is large, useful results can already be obtained for team-sizes below a hundred robots. The methodology presented can be applied to scenarios involving the control of large numbers of entities with limited computational and communication abilities as well as a tight energy budget, such as swarms of robots from the centimeter to nanometer range or sensor networks.},

abstract = {It is a characteristic of swarm robotics that modelling the overall swarm behaviour in terms of the low-level behaviours of individual robots is very difficult. Yet if swarm robotics is to make the transition from the laboratory to real-world engineering realisation such models would be critical for both overall validation of algorithm correctness and detailed parameter optimisation. We seek models with predictive power: models that allow us to determine the effect of modifying parameters in individual robots on the overall swarm behaviour. This paper presents results from a study to apply the probabilistic modelling approach to a class of wireless connected swarms operating in unbounded environments. The paper proposes a probabilistic finite state machine (PFSM) that describes the network connectivity and overall macroscopic behaviour of the swarm, then develops a novel robot-centric approach to the estimation of the state transition probabilities within the PFSM. Using measured data from simulation the paper then carefully validates the PFSM model step by step, allowing us to assess the accuracy and hence the utility of the model.},

In centralized learning, every robot runs the same controller and the performance is evaluated with a global metric. In the distributed learning, robots run different controllers and the performance is evaluated independently on each robot with a local metric.

We employ a decentralized strategy that requires no communication among robots. It is based on the development of a continuous abstraction of the swarm obtained by modeling population fractions and defining the task allocation problem as the selection of rates of robot ingress and egress to and from each task. These rates are used to determine probabilities that define stochastic control policies for individual robots, which, in turn, produce the desired collective behavior. We address the problem of computing rates to achieve fast redistribution of the swarm subject to constraint(s) on switching between tasks at equilibrium. We present several formulations of this optimization problem that vary in the precedence constraints between tasks and in their dependence on the initial robot distribution. We use each formulation to optimize the rates for a scenario with four tasks and compare the resulting control policies using a simulation in which 250 robots redistribute themselves among four buildings to survey the perimeters.},

The algorithm consists of three phases: 1) an initial allocation of the subtasks to each robot via a variant of Dijkstra's algorithm; 2) a component trading protocol to balance each robot's workload without violating any constraints; and 3) the creation of an assembly plan for each robot that minimizes conflicts during execution.

abstract = {We present a decentralized, scalable approach to assembling a group of heterogeneous parts into different products using a swarm of robots. While the assembly plans are predetermined, the exact sequence of assembly of parts and the allocation of subassembly tasks to robots are determined by the interactions between robots in a decentralized fashion in real time. Our approach is based on developing a continuous abstraction of the system derived from models of chemical reactions and formulating the strategy as a problem of selecting rates of assembly and disassembly. These rates are mapped onto probabilities that determine stochastic control policies for individual robots, which then produce the desired aggregate behavior. This top-down approach to determining robot controllers also allows us to optimize the rates at the abstract level to achieve fast convergence to the specified target numbers of products. Because the method incorporates programs for assembly and disassembly, changes in demand can lead to reconfiguration in a seamless fashion. We illustrate the methodology using a physics-based simulator with examples involving 15 robots and two types of final products.},

Tasks that are sequentially interdependent are common in natural and artificial systems. The proposed method does neither rely on global knowledge nor centralized components. Moreover, it does not require the robots to communicate. The method is based on the delay experienced by the robots working on one subtask when waiting for input from another subtask. We explore the capabilities of the method in different simulated environments. Additionally, we evaluate the method in a proof-of-concept experiment using real robots. We show that the method allows a swarm to reach a near-optimal allocation in the studied environments, can easily be transferred to a real robot setting, and is adaptive to changes in the properties of the tasks such as their duration. Finally, we show that the ideal setting of the parameters of the method does not depend on the properties of the environment.},

abstract = {Research in swarm robotics focuses mostly on how robots interact and cooperate to perform tasks, rather than on the details of task execution. As a consequence, researchers often consider abstract tasks in their experimental work. For example, foraging is often studied without physically handling objects: the retrieval of an object from a source to a destination is abstracted into a trip between the two locations—no object is physically transported. Despite being commonly used, so far task abstraction has only been implemented in an ad hoc fashion. In this paper, we propose a new approach to abstracting complex tasks in swarm robotics research. This approach is based on a physical device called the " task abstraction module " (TAM) that abstracts single-robot tasks to be performed by an e-puck robot. A complex multi-robot task can be abstracted using a group of TAMs by first modeling the task as the set of its constituent single-robot subtasks and then abstracting each subtask with a TAM. We present a collection of tools for modeling complex tasks, and a framework for controlling a group of TAMs such that the behavior of the group implements the model of the task. The TAM enables research on cooperative behaviors and complex tasks with simple, cost-effective robots such as the e-puck—research that would be difficult and costly to conduct using specialized robots or ad hoc task abstraction. We demonstrate how to abstract a complex task with multiple TAMs in an example scenario involving a swarm of e-puck robots.},

abstract = {This study focuses on issues related to the evolutionary design of task-allocation mechanisms for swarm robotics systems with agents potentially capable of performing different tasks. Task allocation in swarm robotics refers to a process that results in the distribution of robots to different concurrent tasks without any central or hierarchical control. In this paper, we investigate a scenario with two concurrent tasks (i.e. foraging and nest patrolling) and two environments in which the task priorities vary. We are interested in generating successful groups made of behaviourally plastic agents (i.e. agents that are capable of carrying out different tasks in different environmental conditions), which could adapt their task preferences to those of their group mates as well as to the environmental conditions. We compare the results of three different evolutionary design approaches, which differ in terms of the agents' genetic relatedness (i.e. groups of clones and groups of unrelated individuals), and/or the selection criteria used to create new populations (i.e. single and multi-objective evolutionary optimisation algorithms). We show results indicating that the evolutionary approach based on the use of genetically unrelated individuals in combination with a multi-objective evolutionary optimisation algorithm has a better success rate then an evolutionary approach based on the use of genetically related agents. Moreover, the multi-objective approach, when compared to a single-objective approach and genetically unrelated individual, significantly limits the tendency towards task specialisation by favouring the emergence of generalist agents without introducing extra computational costs. The significance of this result is discussed in view of the relationship between individual behavioural skills and swarm effectiveness.},

From elementary system graph representation, systems are shown to belong to only three states: simple, complicated, and complex. First two have been studied over past centuries. Last one originates in existence of threshold above which components interaction overtakes outside interaction, leading to system self-organization which filters outer action, making it more robust with emergence of new behaviour not predictable from components study. The threshold value, expressed in terms of coupling system parameters, is verified to recovers limits found in a broad range of domains in Physics and Mathematics, giving explicit criterion for emergence in complex system. Application to man-made systems concentrates on the balance between relative system isolation when becoming complex and delegation of more " intelligence " in adequate frame between new augmented system state and supervising operator. Entering complexity state opens the possibility for the function to feedback onto the structure, ie to mimic technically the early invention of Nature.},

A number of simple agents move in this dirty region, each having the ability to "clean" the place it is located in. Their goal is to jointly clean the given dirty region. The dynamic variant of the problem involves a deterministic expansion of dirt in the environment, simulating spreading of contamination or fire. Theoretical lower bounds for the problem are presented, as well as various impossibility results. A cleaning protocol for the problem is presented, and a wealth of experimental results testing its performance in comparison to the lower bounds. Several analytic upper bounds for the proposed protocol are also presented, accompanied with appropriate experimental results.},

Our work is inspired by experimental studies of ant house hunting and empirical models that predict the behavior of the colony that is faced with a choice between multiple candidate nests. We design quorum based stochastic control policies that enable the team of agents to distribute themselves among multiple candidate sites in a specified ratio, and compare our results to the linear stochastic policies described in (Halasz et al., in Proceedings of the International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS'07), pp. 2320--2325, 2007). We show how our quorum model consistently performs better than the linear models while minimizing computational requirements and now it can be implemented without the use of inter-agent wireless communication.},

abstract = {In this article, we present property-driven design, a novel top-down design method for robot swarms based on prescriptivemodeling and model checking. Traditionally, robot swarms have been developed using a code-and-fix approach: in a bottom-up iterative process, the developer tests and improves the individual behaviors of the robots until the desired collective behavior is obtained. The code-and-fix approach is unstructured, and the quality of the obtained swarm depends completely on the expertise and ingenuity of the developer who has little scientific or technical support in his activity. Property-driven design aims at providing such scientific and technical support, with many advantages compared to the traditional unstructured approach. Property-driven design is composed of four phases: first, the developer formally specifies the requirements of the robot swarm by stating its desired properties; second, the developer creates a prescriptive model of the swarm and uses model checking to verify that this prescriptive model satisfies the desired properties; third, using the prescriptive model as a blueprint, the developer implements a simulated version of the desired robot swarm and validates the prescriptive model developed in the previous step; fourth, the developer implements the desired robot swarm and validates the previous steps. We demonstrate property-driven design using two case studies: aggregation and foraging.},

abstract = {This paper presents a survey on multi-robot search inspired by swarm intelligence by further classifying and discussing the theoretical advantages and disadvantages of the existing studies. Subsequently, the most attractive techniques are evaluated and compared by highlighting their most relevant features. This is motivated by the gradual growth of swarm robotics solutions in situations where conventional search cannot find a satisfactory solution. For instance, exhaustive multi-robot search techniques, such as sweeping the environment, allow for a better avoidance of local solutions but require too much time to find the optimal one. Moreover, such techniques tend to fail in finding targets within dynamic and unstructured environments. This paper presents experiments conducted to benchmark five state-of-the-art algorithms for cooperative exploration tasks. The simulated experimental results show the superiority of the previously presented Robotic Darwinian Particle Swarm Optimization (RDPSO), evidencing that sociobiological inspiration is useful to meet the challenges of robotic applications that can be described as optimization problems (e.g., search and rescue). Moreover, the RDPSO is further compared with the best performing algorithms within a population of 14 e-pucks. It is observed that the RDPSO algorithm converges to the optimal solution faster and more accurately than the other approaches without significantly increasing the computational demand, memory and communication complexity. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Task partitioning impacts tasks execution and associated costs. Our approach is characterized by the use of a cost function, mapping the size of sub-tasks to the overall task cost. The robots model the cost function and use the model to select sub-tasks to perform, aiming to minimize costs. Our approach separates the task partitioning process from task-specific actions and it does not require a priori assumptions to be made about the best partitioning strategy to employ. We study a foraging scenario in which object transportation is performed by different robots, each moving objects for a limited distance. The robots autonomously decide the distance traveled on the basis of our approach. The robots use odometry for navigational purposes; we show that task partitioning reduces the impact of odometry errors and improves performance. We validate our approach using simulation-based experiments. We study how the swarm partitions transportation under a number of experimental conditions characterized by different levels of odometry accuracy, size of the environment and the swarm, and total transportation distance. Our approach leads to partitioning solutions that are appropriate for each condition.},

A natural outgrowth of these advances are systems comprised of large numbers of robots that collaborate autonomously in diverse applications. Research on effective au-tonomous control of such systems, commonly called swarms, has increased dramatically in recent years and received attention from many domains, such as bioinspired robotics and control theory. These kinds of distributed systems present novel challenges for the effective integration of human supervisors, operators, and team-mates that are only beginning to be addressed. This paper is the first survey of human–swarm interaction (HSI) and identifies the core concepts needed to design a human–swarm system. We first present the basics of swarm robotics. Then, we introduce HSI from the perspective of a human operator by discussing the cognitive complexity of solving tasks with swarm systems. Next, we introduce the interface between swarm and operator and identify challenges and solutions relating to human–swarm communication, state es-timation and visualization, and human control of swarms. For the latter, we develop a taxonomy of control methods that enable op-erators to control swarms effectively. Finally, we synthesize the results to highlight remaining challenges, unanswered questions, and open problems for HSI, as well as how to address them in future works.

abstract = {This paper proposes a strategy for a group of swarm robots to self-assemble into a single articulated(legged) structure in response to terrain difficulties during autonomous exploration. These articulated structures will have several articulated legs or backbones, so they are well suited to walk on difficult terrains like animals. There are three tasks in this strategy: exploration, self-assembly and locomotion. We propose a formation self-assembly method to improve self-assembly efficiency. At the beginning, a swarm of robots explore the environment using their sensors and decide whether to self-assemble and select a target configuration from a library to form some robotic structures to finish a task. Then, the swarm of robots will execute a self-assembling task to construct the corresponding configuration of an articulated robot. For the locomotion, with joint actuation from the connected robots, the articulated robot generates locomotive motions. Based on Sambot that are designed to unite swarm mobile and self-reconfigurable robots, we demonstrate the feasibility for a varying number of swarm robots to self-assemble into snake-like and multi-legged robotic structures. Then, the effectiveness and scalability of the strategy are discussed with two groups of experiments and it proves the formation self-assembly is more efficient in the end. {\textcopyright} 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {Division of labor is ubiquitous in biological systems, as evidenced by various forms of complex task specialization observed in both animal societies and multicellular organisms. Although clearly adaptive, the way in which division of labor first evolved remains enigmatic, as it requires the simultaneous co-occurrence of several complex traits to achieve the required degree of coordination. Recently, evolutionary swarm robotics has emerged as an excellent test bed to study the evolution of coordinated group-level behavior. Here we use this framework for the first time to study the evolutionary origin of behavioral task specialization among groups of identical robots. The scenario we study involves an advanced form of division of labor, common in insect societies and known as "task partitioning", whereby two sets of tasks have to be carried out in sequence by different individuals. Our results show that task partitioning is favored whenever the environment has features that, when exploited, reduce switching costs and increase the net efficiency of the group, and that an optimal mix of task specialists is achieved most readily when the behavioral repertoires aimed at carrying out the different subtasks are available as pre-adapted building blocks. Nevertheless, we also show for the first time that self-organized task specialization could be evolved entirely from scratch, starting only from basic, low-level behavioral primitives, using a nature-inspired evolutionary method known as Grammatical Evolution. Remarkably, division of labor was achieved merely by selecting on overall group performance, and without providing any prior information on how the global object retrieval task was best divided into smaller subtasks. We discuss the potential of our method for engineering adaptively behaving robot swarms and interpret our results in relation to the likely path that nature took to evolve complex sociality and task specialization.},

An efficient labour division model, with the ability to regulate the distribution of work among swarm robots, is an important element of this kind of system. This paper extends the popular response threshold model and proposes a new adaptive response threshold model (ARTM). Experiments were carried out in simulation and in real-robot scenarios with the aim of studying the performance of this new adaptive model. Results presented in this paper verify that the extended approach improves on the adaptability of previous systems. For example, by reducing collision duration among robots in foraging missions, our approach helps small swarms of robots to adapt more efficiently to changing environments, thus increasing their self-sustainability (survival rate). Finally, we propose a minimal version of ARTM, which is derived from the conclusions drawn through real-robot and simulation results.},

While mechanisms for assessing the effectiveness of any swarm algorithm before deployment are essential, such mechanisms have traditionally involved either computational simulations of swarm behaviour, or experiments with robot swarms themselves.

Self-organized task partitioning in artificial swarm systems is currently not widely studied, although it has clear advantages in large groups. We propose a fully decentralized adaptive method that allows a swarm of robots to autonomously decide whether to partition a task into two sequential subtasks or not.

abstract = {Cooperation is a key concept used in multi-robot systems for performing complex tasks. In swarm robotics, a self-organized cooperation is applied, where robots with limited intelligence cooperate and interact locally to build up the desired global behavior. In this paper, we are studying a mobile object tracking scenario performed by a swarm of robots. The robustness, scalability and flexibility of swarm robots make it an attractive approach for missions like object tracking in complex and dynamic environments. As the individual robot capabilities are limited in swarm systems, the robots may not be able to track the mobile object continuously. This limitation is overcome using the robots communication capability. In order to increase the probability of object detection, we propose a greedy self-deployment strategy, where the robots are spread uniformly in the environment to be monitored. For detecting a moving target, the robots use a biologically inspired algorithm for collecting robots currently located in other regions to track the target. In such cooperative tasks the robots normally need to be time synchronized for simultaneous activation. A new proposal for time synchronization in swarm robots is introduced which exploits the mobility of the robots for handling possible disconnections in the network and synchronize them at the beginning of tracking time slots.},

abstract = {Task partitioning is the decomposition of a task into two or more sub-tasks that can be tackled separately. Task partitioning can be observed in many species of social in- sects, as it is often an advantageous way of organizing the work of a group of individuals. Potential advantages of task partitioning are, among others: reduction of interference be- tween workers, exploitation of individuals' skills and specializations, energy efficiency, and higher parallelism. Even though swarms of robots can benefit from task partitioning in the same way as social insects do, only few works in swarm robotics are dedicated to this sub- ject. In this paper, we study the case in which a swarm of robots has to tackle a task that can be partitioned into a sequence of two sub-tasks. We propose a method that allows the individual robots in the swarm to decide whether to partition the given task or not. The method is self-organized, relies on the experience of each individual, and does not require explicit communication between robots.We evaluate themethod in simulation experiments, using foraging as testbed.We study cases in which task partitioning is preferable and cases in which it is not. We show that the proposed method leads to good performance of the swarm in both cases, by employing task partitioning only when it is advantageous.We also show that the swarm is able to react to changes in the environmental conditions by adapting the behavior on-line. Scalability experiments show that the proposed method performs well across all the tested group sizes.},

Simulation software is mostly used for performing research in swarm robotics due the hardware complexities and cost of robot platforms. However, simulation of large numbers of these swarm robots is extremely complex and often inaccurate. In this paper we present the design of a low-cost, open-platform, autonomous micro robot (Colias) for swarm robotic applications. Colias uses a circular platform with a diameter of 4 cm. Long-range infrared modules with adjustable output power allow the robot to communicate with its direct neighbours.

The interactions among the robots are based on simple behavioral rules that exploit only local information. The robots in a swarm have neither global knowledge, nor a central controller. Therefore, decisions in the swarm have to be taken in a distributed manner based on local interactions.

This article formalizes the concept of group dynamics in the framework of scheduling and presents a proof that multi-robot task allocation (MRTA), in systems with significant performance effects from group dynamics, is an N P-complete problem. As a way of dealing with this complexity we have developed vacancy chain scheduling (VCS), a new formal model of MRTA inspired by a resource distribution process commonly found in nature. VCS is also the foundation of a new MRTA algorithm which relies on optimal allocation patterns to emerge from the stigmergic effects of robot interactions. We present experimental evidence of the validity of the VCS model from high-fidelity simulations. The experimental results validate the VCS model by reliably producing the predicted allocation patterns in both homogeneous and heterogeneous groups of robots. The evidence also supports our claim that VCS is a feasible solution for a restricted class of MRTA problems. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Currently, the control software of swarm robotics systems is created by ad hoc development. This makes it hard to deploy these systems in real-world scenarios. In particular, it is difficult to maintain, analyse, or verify the systems. Formal methods can contribute to overcome these problems. However, they usually do not guarantee that the implementation matches the specification, because the system's control code is typically generated manually. Also, there is cultural resistance to apply formal methods; they may be perceived as an additional step that does not add value to the final product. To address these problems, we propose supervisory control theory for the domain of swarm robotics. The advantages of supervisory control theory, and its associated tools, are a reduction in the amount of ad hoc development, the automatic generation of control code from modelled specifications, proofs of properties over generated control code, and the reusability of formally designed controllers between different robotic platforms. These advantages are demonstrated in four case studies using the e-puck and Kilobot robot platforms. Experiments with up to 600 physical robots are reported, which show that supervisory control theory can be used to formally develop state-of-the-art solutions to a range of problems in swarm robotics.},

abstract = {We study self-organized cooperation between heterogeneous robotic swarms. The robots of each swarm play distinct roles based on their different characteristics.We investigate how the use of simple local interactions between the robots of the different swarms can let the swarms cooperate in order to solve complex tasks. We focus on an indoor navigation task, in which we use a swarm of wheeled robots, called foot-bots, and a swarm of flying robots that can attach to the ceiling, called eye-bots. The task of the foot-bots is to move back and forth between a source and a target location. The role of the eye-bots is to guide foot-bots: they choose positions at the ceiling and from there give local directional instructions to foot-bots passing by. To obtain efficient paths for foot-bot navigation, eye-bots need on the one hand to choose good positions and on the other hand learn the right instructions to give.We investigate each of these aspects. Our solution is based on a process of mutual adaptation, in which foot-bots execute instructions given by eye-bots, and eye-bots observe the behavior of foot-bots to adapt their position and the instructions they give. Our approach is inspired by pheromone mediated navigation of ants, as eye-bots serve as stigmergic markers for foot-bot navigation. Through simulation, we show how this system is able to find ef- ficient paths in complex environments, and to display different kinds of complex and scalable self-organized behaviors, such as shortest path finding and automatic traffic spreading.},

abstract = {Task partitioning consists in dividing a task into sub-tasks that can be tackled separately. Partitioning a task might have both positive and negative effects: On the one hand, partitioning might reduce physical interference between workers, enhance exploitation of specialization, and increase efficiency. On the other hand, partitioning may introduce over- heads due to coordination requirements. As a result, whether partitioning is advantageous or not has to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. In this paper we consider the case in which a swarm of robots must decide whether to complete a given task as an unpartitioned task, or utilize task partitioning and tackle it as a sequence of two sub-tasks. We show that the problem of selecting between the two options can be formulated as a multi-armed bandit problem and tackled with algorithms that have been proposed in the reinforcement learning literature. Additionally, we study the implications of using explicit communication between the robots to tackle the studied task partitioning problem. We consider a foraging scenario as a testbed and we perform simulation-based experiments to evaluate the behavior of the system. The results confirm that existing multi-armed bandit algorithms can be employed in the context of task partitioning. The use of communication can result in better performance, but in may also hinder the flexibility of the system. Keywords},

Many experiments on so-called public goods games have shown that in the absence of such institutions, individuals are willing to punish defectors, even at a cost to themselves. Theoretical models confirm that social norms prescribing the punishment of uncooperative behavior are stable-once established, they prevent dissident minorities from spreading. But how can such costly punishing behavior gain a foothold in the population? A surprisingly simple model shows that if individuals have the option to stand aside and abstain from the joint endeavor, this paves the way for the emergence and establishment of cooperative behavior based on the punishment of defectors. Paradoxically, the freedom to withdraw from the common enterprise leads to enforcement of social norms. Joint enterprises that are compulsory rather than voluntary are less likely to lead to cooperation.},

An initial dense, stationary configuration of robots distributively forms a coordinate system, and each robot decides if it is part of the desired shape. Non-shape robots then re-move themselves from the configuration using a single external light source as a motion guide. The subtractive approach allows for a higher degree of motion paral-lelism than additive approaches; it is also tolerant of much lower-precision motion. Experiments with 725 Kilobot robots allow us to compare our method against an additive one that was previously evaluated on the same platform. The subtractive method leads to higher reliability and an order-of-magnitude improvement in shape formation speed.},

The approach combines game-theoretic reasoning and pure opponent modeling, yielding a hybrid that can effectively exploit opponents after only a small number of interactions. Unlike prior opponent modeling approaches, ours is fundamentally game theoretic and takes advantage of recent algorithms for automated abstraction and equilibrium computation rather than relying on domain-specific prior distributions, historical data, or a hand-crafted set of features. Experiments show that our algorithm leads to significantly higher win rates (than an approximate- equilibrium strategy) against several opponents in limit Texas Hold'em — the most studied imperfect-information game in computer science — including competitors from recent AAAI computer poker competitions.},

abstract = {— In this paper, we demonstrate how topological con-straints, as well as other abstract constraints, can be integ-rated into task allocation by applying the combinatorial the-ory of matroids. By modeling problems as an intersection of matroid constraints, arbitrary combinatorial relationships can be achieved in the task allocation space. To illustrate the ex-pressiveness of the framework, we model a novel task allocation problem that couples abstract per-robot constraints with a com-munication spanning tree constraint. As our problem is cast as a matroid intersection, provable optimality bounds with simple greedy algorithms follows immediately from theory. Next, we present a decentralized algorithm that applies auction methods to task allocation with matroid intersections. Simulations of task allocation for surveillance in urban environments demonstrate our results. Finally, Monte Carlo results are provided that indic-ate greedy task allocations can be highly competitive even with near-optimal solutions in practice.},

abstract = {Reinforcement learning policies face the exploration versus exploitation dilemma, i.e. the search for a balance between exploring the environment to find profitable actions while taking the empirically best action as often as possible. A popular measure of a policy's success in addressing this dilemma is the regret, that is the loss due to the fact that the globally optimal policy is not followed all the times. One of the simplest examples of the exploration/exploitation dilemma is the multi-armed bandit problem. Lai and Robbins were the first ones to show that the regret for this problem has to grow at least logarithmically in the number of plays. Since then, policies which asymptotically achieve this regret have been devised by Lai and Robbins and many others. In this work we show that the optimal logarithmic regret is also achievable uniformly over time, with simple and efficient policies, and for all reward distributions with bounded support.},

abstract = {In this paper we present queueing-theoretical methods for the modeling, analysis, and control of autonomous mobility-on-demand (MOD) systems wherein robotic, self-driving vehicles transport customers within an urban environment and rebalance themselves to ensure acceptable quality of service throughout the network. We first cast an autonomous MOD system within a closed Jackson network model with passenger loss. It is shown that an optimal rebalancing algorithm minimizing the number of (autonomously) rebalancing vehicles while keeping vehicle availabilities balanced throughout the network can be found by solving a linear program. The theoretical insights are used to design a robust, real-time reba-lancing algorithm, which is applied to a case study of New York City and implemented on an eight-vehicle mobile robot testbed. The case study of New York shows that the current taxi demand in Manhattan can be met with about 8,000 robotic vehicles (roughly 70{\%} of the size of the current taxi fleet operating in Manhattan). Finally, we extend our queueing-theoretical setup to include congestion effects, and study the impact of autonomously rebalancing vehicles on overall congestion. Using a simple heuristic algorithm, we show that additional congestion due to autonomous rebalan-cing can be effectively avoided on a road network. Collectively, this paper provides a rigorous approach to the problem of system-wide coordination of autonomously driving vehicles, and provides one of the first characterizations of the sustainability benefits of robotic transportation networks.},

abstract = {We describe a general mechanism for adaptation in multiagent systems in which agents modify their behavior based on their memory of past events. These behavior changes can be elicited by environmental dynamics or arise as response to the actions of other agents. The agents use memory to estimate the global state of the system from individual observations and adjust their actions accordingly. We also present a mathematical model of the dynamics of collective behavior in such systems and apply it to study adaptive coalition formation in electronic marketplaces. In adaptive coalition formation, the agents are more likely to join smaller coalitions than larger ones while there are many small coalitions. The rationale behind this is that smaller coalitions are necessary to nucleate larger ones. The agents remember the sizes of coalition they encountered and use them to estimate the mean coalition size. They decide whether to join a new coalition based on how close its size is to the mean coalition size. We show that the adaptive system displays most of the features of the non-adaptive one, but results in better long term system performance.},

abstract = {Dynamic task allocation is an essential requirement for multi-robot systems operating in unknown dynamic environments. It allows robots to change their behavior in response to environmental changes or actions of other robots in order to improve overall system performance. Emergent coordination algorithms for task allocation that use only local sensing and no direct communication between robots are attractive because they are robust and scalable. However, a lack of formal analysis tools makes emergent coordination algorithms difficult to design. In this paper we present a mathematical model of a general dynamic task allocation mechanism. Robots using this mechanism have to choose between two types of tasks, and the goal is to achieve a desired task division in the absence of explicit communication and global knowledge. Robots estimate the state of the environment from repeated local observations and decide which task to choose based on these observations. We model the robots and observations as stochastic processes and study the dynamics of the collective behavior. Specifically, we analyze the effect that the number of observations and the choice of the decision function have on the performance of the system. The mathematical models are validated in a multi-robot multi-foraging scenario. The model's predictions agree very closely with results of embodied simulations.},

Such swarms rely on: the simplicity of the individual robots; the fault tolerance inherent in having a large population of often identical robots; and the self-organised behaviour of the swarm as a whole. Although robot swarms are being deployed in increasingly sophisticated areas, designing individual control algorithms that can guarantee the required global behaviour is difficult. In this paper we apply and assess the use of formal verification techniques, in particular that of model checking, for analysing the emergent behaviours of robotic swarms. These techniques, based on the automated analysis of systems using temporal logics, allow us to analyse all possible behaviours and so identify potential problems with the robot swarm conforming to some required global behaviour. To show this approach we target a particular swarm control algorithm, and show how automated temporal analysis can help to refine and analyse such an algorithm. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Agent-based approaches to manufacturing scheduling and control have gained increasing attention in recent years. Such approaches are attractive because they offer increased robustness against the unpredictability of factory operations. But the specification of local coordination policies that give rise to efficient global performance and effectively adapt to changing circumstances remains an interesting challenge. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to this coordination problem, drawing on various aspects of a computational model of how wasp colonies coordinate individual activities and allocate tasks to meet the collective needs of the nest. We focus specifically on the problem of configuring machines in a factory to best satisfy (potentially changing) product demands over time. Our system models the set of jobs queued in front of any given machine as a wasp nest, wherein wasp-like agents interact to form a social hierarchy and prioritize the jobs that they represent. Other wasp-like agents external to the nest act as overall machine proxies, and use a model of wasp task allocation behavior to determine which new jobs should be accepted into the machine's queue. We show for simple factories that our multi-agent system achieves the desired effect. For a given job mix, the system converges to a factory configuration that maximizes overall performance, and as the job mix changes, the system quickly adapts to a new, more appropriate configuration.},

Economists found that the addition of workers into a group results in their contributing progressively less productivity; a concept called the Law of Marginal Returns. We study groups that differ in their coordination algorithms, and note that they display increasing marginal returns only until a certain group size. After this point the groups' productivity drops with the addition of robots. Interestingly, the group size where this phenomenon occurs varies between groups using differing coordination methods. We define a measure of interference that enables comparison, and find a high negative correlation between interference and productivity within these groups. Effective coordination algorithms maintain increasing productivity over larger groups by reducing the team's interference levels. Using this result we are able to examine the productivity of robotic groups in several simulated domains in thousands of trials. We find that in theory groups should always add productivity during size scale-up, but spatial limitations within domains cause robots to fail to achieve this ideal. We believe that coordination methods can be developed that improve a group's performance by minimizing interference. We present our findings of composite coordination methods that provide evidence of this claim. {\textcopyright} 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.},

The applications of swarm technology to unmanned systems are in the infancy of realization, although clear benefits from the enhanced capabilities can be easily envisioned for commercial and government missions including persistent search, long-term monitoring, sensor data collection, object retrieval, and offensive attack missions. Designing a UAV swarm architecture without considering the mission doctrine is imprudent, as is developing a mission doctrine without understanding the unique capabilities of swarm technology. This paper provides a literature review of current UAV swarm design architectures, most of which employ bottom-up methods with little consideration for an intended operational mission. The proposed top-down framework and modeling approach is focused on developing a modular UAV swarm playbook-type architecture by decomposing a subset of US Navy missions, and developing tactics that can be applied to those missions and support future missions. The framework proposed herein is derived from a consolidation of heuristics from the model-based systems engineering, robotics, human systems integration, biology, and computer science disciplines. The goal of this framework is to provide a standard methodology for designing and operating swarm unmanned systems that will meet the performance requirements for military missions. In this paper, an integrated framework for designing a UAV swarm system with swarm mission doctrine as a primary design factor is presented.},

User defined and preinstalled maps can be very useful in navigation in complex environments, while adaptively built maps become very essential in unknown environments. Intelligence is bestowed in the effective utilization of data to produce decisions. In the case of navigation, intelligence is seen when information collected en-route from a source to a destination is used judiciously in reaching the destination. In this paper we deal with the foraging of a piece of terrain as a process of navigation. The application here is mine detection. Mines are placed over a field at unknown locations and swarm intelligence based agents are deployed for demining them. The efficiency of the demining process is measured in terms of the quickness with which they can clear the mines and the assurance that the minefield is clear of all of the mines at the end of the process. Simulation results acknowledging the performance under different working conditions of the swarm robots are presented. In an endeavor to substantiate our claims in simulation we decided to build swarm robots performing the task on an artificially developed environment.},

After presenting the general model, we analyze in detail a case study of collaboration, the stick-pulling experiment, studied experimentally and in simulation by Ijspeert et al. [Autonomous Robots, 11, 149-171]. The robots' task is to pull sticks out of their holes, and it can be successfully achieved only through the collaboration of two robots. There is no explicit communication or coordination between the robots. Unlike microscopic simulations (sensor-based or using a probabilistic numerical model), in which computational time scales with the robot group size, the macroscopic model is computationally efficient, because its solutions are independent of robot group size. Analysis reproduces several qualitative conclusions of Ijspeert et al.: namely, the different dynamical regimes for different values of the ratio of robots to sticks, the existence of optimal control parameters that maximize system performance as a function of group size, and the transition from superlinear to sublinear performance as the number of robots is increased. {\textcopyright} 2002 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

We capture the dynamics of the system at a higher abstraction level using non-spatial, probabilistic, discrete-time macroscopic models, which we use in an optimal control framework to find an optimal collaboration policy minimizing time to completion and overall energy consumption of the swarm. We consider time-invariant and time-variant decision variables for various stage constraints (energy consumption), and find optimal profiles using an extremum-seeking control scheme. In particular, we show that using a communication-based policy exclusively towards the end of the inspection progress decreases time to task completion, but only if there are at least as many robots as blades.

Based on these properties, a fitness function is defined to characterize the structured patterns that can be generated by the model. The fitness function assigns a value to each pattern. The choice of the fitness function is validated by the fact that human observers tend to view patterns with high (resp. low) fitness as structured (resp. unstructured). A genetic algorithm based on this fitness function is used to explore the space of possible patterns. The genetic algorithm is able to make use of sub-modules of existing patterns and recombine them to produce novel patterns, but strong epistatic interactions among genes make the fitness landscape rugged and prevent more complex patterns from being produced.

Predictions about robotic missions to the planet Mars have described such site preparation as essential to the success of later mission objectives, such as the construction of solar arrays, etc. This algorithm was based on a behaviour observed in a particular species of ant called "blind bulldozing." We developed a mathematical model of bund bulldozing using a unique approach based on Markov chains. Robot bulldozers were developed and used to test the algorithm in our laboratory. The team of robots was found to be successful at clearing an open area out of a field of rocks. Our robots' behaviour also agreed with the predictions of our model. This work is significant because it demonstrates the viability of blind bulldozing and represents the first time, to our knowledge, that a multiple robot system has carried out a form of the general construction task outside of simulation.},

abstract = {The distributed control of self-assembly processes requires local behaviors that will cause initially unorganized components to form a desired goal structure. While important strides have been made in designing methods for self-assembling various geometric structures under idealized simulated conditions, many unaddressed issues remain in extending these methods to more complex environments. In this work, we discuss the self-assembly of prespecified 3D structures from blocks of different sizes. Block movements through a continuous environment are constrained by each other and simulated gravity, adding to the problem's difficulty. We present a solution that integrates three distinct techniques from the field of swarm intelligence: stigmergic pattern recognition, force-based movement control, and coordination via local message passing and state changes. Further, we empirically demonstrate that a stochastic component in the blocks' acceleration can aid in preventing persistent interference, and that the use of collective, flock-like movements can be beneficial in situations of low block availability. This work provides insight into the dynamics of continuous-space self-assembly, and is a step towards the design of methods for the automated "growth" of useful structures in real-world environments. {\textcopyright} 2006 - IOS Press and the authors(s).

abstract={How groups of cooperative foragers can achieve efficient and robust collective foraging is of interest both to biologists studying social insects and engineers designing swarm robotics systems. Of particular interest are distance-quality trade-offs and swarm-size-dependent foraging strategies. Here, we present a collective foraging system based on virtual pheromones, tested in simulation and in swarms of up to 200 physical robots. Our individual agent controllers are highly simplified, as they are based on binary pheromone sensors. Despite being simple, our individual controllers are able to reproduce classical foraging experiments conducted with more capable real ants that sense pheromone concentration and follow its gradient. One key feature of our controllers is a control parameter which balances the trade-off between distance selectivity and quality selectivity of individual foragers. We construct an optimal foraging theory model that accounts for distance and quality of resources, as well as overcrowding, and predicts a swarm-size-dependent strategy. We test swarms implementing our controllers against our optimality model and find that, for moderate swarm sizes, they can be parameterised to approximate the optimal foraging strategy. This study demonstrates the sufficiency of simple individual agent rules to generate sophisticated collective foraging behaviour.},

pages={909-926},
abstract={Teams of robots can be organized to collectively complete complex real-world tasks, for example collective foraging in which robots search for, pick up, and drop off targets in a collection zone. In the previously proposed central-place foraging algorithm (CPFA), foraging performance decreases as swarm size and search areas scale up: more robots produce more inter-robot collisions and larger search areas produce longer travel distances. We propose the multiple-place foraging algorithm with dynamic depots ({\$}{\$}{\backslash}hbox {\{}MPFA{\}}{\_}{\{}dynamic{\}}{\$}{\$}MPFAdynamic) to address these problems. Depots are special robots which are initially distributed in the search area and can carry multiple targets. Depots move to the centroids of the positions of local targets recently detected by robots. The spatially distributed design reduces robot transport time and reduces collisions among robots. We simulate robot swarms that mimic foraging ants using the {\$}{\$}{\backslash}hbox {\{}MPFA{\}}{\_}{\{}dynamic{\}}{\$}{\$}MPFAdynamicstrategy, employing a genetic algorithm to optimize their behavior in the robot simulator ARGoS. Robots using the {\$}{\$}{\backslash}hbox {\{}MPFA{\}}{\_}{\{}dynamic{\}}{\$}{\$}MPFAdynamicfind and collect targets faster than both the CPFA and the static MPFA. {\$}{\$}{\backslash}hbox {\{}MPFA{\}}{\_}{\{}dynamic{\}}{\$}{\$}MPFAdynamicoutperforms the static MPFA even when the static depots are optimally placed using global information, and it outperforms the CPFA even when the dynamic depots deliver targets to a central location. Further, the {\$}{\$}{\backslash}hbox {\{}MPFA{\}}{\_}{\{}dynamic{\}}{\$}{\$}MPFAdynamicscales up more efficiently, so that the improvement over the CPFA and the static MPFA is even greater in large (50 {\$}{\$}{\backslash}times {\$}{\$}{\texttimes}50 m) areas. Including simulated error reduces foraging performance across all algorithms, but the MPFA still outperforms the other approaches. Our work demonstrates that dispersed agents that dynamically adapt to local information in their environment provide more flexible and scalable swarms. In addition, we illustrate a path to implement the {\$}{\$}{\backslash}hbox {\{}MPFA{\}}{\_}{\{}dynamic{\}}{\$}{\$}MPFAdynamicin the physical robot swarm of the NASA Swarmathon competition.},

abstract={We introduce AutoMoDe: a novel approach to the automatic design of control software for robot swarms. The core idea in AutoMoDe recalls the approach commonly adopted in machine learning for dealing with the bias--variance tradedoff: to obtain suitably general solutions with low variance, an appropriate design bias is injected. AutoMoDe produces robot control software by selecting, instantiating, and combining preexisting parametric modules---the injected bias. The resulting control software is a probabilistic finite state machine in which the topology, the transition rules and the values of the parameters are obtained automatically via an optimization process that maximizes a task-specific objective function. As a proof of concept, we define AutoMoDe-Vanilla, which is a specialization of AutoMoDe for the e-puck robot. We use AutoMoDe-Vanilla to design the robot control software for two different tasks: aggregation and foraging. The results show that the control software produced by AutoMoDe-Vanilla (i) yields good results, (ii) appears to be robust to the so called reality gap, and (iii) is naturally human-readable.},

The learning mechanisms themselves are defined by parameters which can be either fixed or inherited.

Biased random walk can be used also for artificial creatures as a very simple and robust control policy for tasks like goal reaching. In this paper, we show how a very simple control law based on random walk is able to guide mobile robot equipped with an omnidirectional camera toward a target without any knowledge about the robot's actuators or about the robot's camera parameters. We verified, by several simulation experiments, the robustness of the random biased control law with respect to failures of robot's actuators or sensor damages. These damages are similar to the ones which can occur during a RoboCup match. The tests show that the optimal behavior is obtained using a bias which is roughly proportional to the random walk step, with a coefficient dependent on the physical structure of the robot, on its actuators and on and its sensors after the damage. Finally, we validated the proposed approach with experiments in the real world with a wheeled robot performing a goal reaching task in a Middle-Size RoboCup field without any prior knowledge on the actuators and without any calibration of the very noisy omnidirectional camera mounted on the robot.",

abstract="This paper challenges the common assumption that swarm robotic systems are robust and scalable by default. We present an analysis based on both reliability modelling and experimental trials of a case study swarm performing team work, in which failures are deliberately induced. Our case study has been carefully chosen to represent a swarm task in which the overall desired system behaviour is an emergent property of the interactions between robots, in order that we can assess the fault tolerance of a self-organising system. Our findings show that in the presence of worst-case partially failed robots the overall system reliability quickly falls with increasing swarm size. We conclude that future large scale swarm systems will need a new approach to achieving high levels of fault tolerance.",

abstract={Supervisory control of swarms is essential to their deployment in real-world scenarios to both monitor their operation and provide guidance. We explore mechanisms by which humans can provide supervisory control to swarms to improve their performance. Rather than have humans guess the correct form of supervisory control, we use artificial evolution to learn effective human-readable strategies. Behaviour trees are applied to represent human-readable decision strategies which are produced through evolution. These strategies can be thoroughly tested and can provide knowledge to be used in the future in a variety of scenarios. A simulated set of scenarios are investigated where a swarm of robots have to explore varying environments and reach sets of objectives. Effective supervisory control strategies are evolved to explore each environment using different local swarm behaviours. The evolved behaviour trees are examined in detail alongside swarm simulations to enable clear understanding of the supervisory strategies. We conclude by identifying the strengths in accelerated testing and the benefits of this approach for scenario exploration and training of human operators.},

The problem can be modeled as a typical reactive synthesis problem by introducing auxiliary propositions and fairness assumptions, at the expense of additional computational complexity. We develop new realizability and synthesis algorithms that address the problem without adding auxiliary propositions or assumptions. We discuss the complexity of both approaches. We then apply our algorithms to synthesize controllers for a swarm robotic system. We implement both approaches and compare them using a specific swarm task.",

    abstract = {Robot swarms are large-scale multirobot systems with decentralized control which means that each robot acts based only on local perception and on local coordination with neighboring robots. The decentralized approach to control confers number of potential benefits. In particular, inherent scalability and robustness are often highlighted as key distinguishing features of robot swarms compared with systems that rely on traditional approaches to multirobot coordination. It has, however, been shown that swarm robotics systems are not always fault tolerant. To realize the robustness potential of robot swarms, it is thus essential to give systems the capacity to actively detect and accommodate faults. In this paper, we present a generic fault-detection system for robot swarms. We show how robots with limited and imperfect sensing capabilities are able to observe and classify the behavior of one another. In order to achieve this, the underlying classifier is an immune system-inspired algorithm that learns to distinguish between normal behavior and abnormal behavior online. Through a series of experiments, we systematically assess the performance of our approach in a detailed simulation environment. In particular, we analyze our system’s capacity to correctly detect robots with faults, false positive rates, performance in a foraging task in which each robot exhibits a composite behavior, and performance under perturbations of the task environment. Results show that our generic fault-detection system is robust, that it is able to detect faults in a timely manner, and that it achieves a low false positive rate. The developed fault-detection system has the potential to enable long-term autonomy for robust multirobot systems, thus increasing the usefulness of robots for a diverse repertoire of upcoming applications in the area of distributed intelligent automation.},

ABSTRACT={Designing collective behaviors for robot swarms is a difficult endeavor due to their fully distributed, highly redundant, and ever-changing nature. To overcome the challenge, a few approaches have been proposed, which can be classified as manual, semi-automatic, or automatic design. This paper is intended to be the manifesto of the automatic off-line design for robot swarms. We define the off-line design problem and illustrate it via a possible practical realization, highlight the core research questions, raise a number of issues regarding the existing literature that is relevant to the automatic off-line design, and provide guidelines that we deem necessary for a healthy development of the domain and for ensuring its relevance to potential real-world applications.}

ABSTRACT={Many insect species, and even some vertebrates, assemble their bodies to form multi-functional materials that combine sensing, computation, and actuation. The tower-building behavior of red imported fire ants, Solenopsis invicta, presents a key example of this phenomenon of collective construction. While biological studies of collective construction focus on behavioral assays to measure the dynamics of formation and studies of swarm robotics focus on developing hardware that can assemble and interact, algorithms for designing such collective aggregations have been mostly overlooked. We address this gap by formulating an agent-based model for collective tower-building with a set of behavioral rules that incorporate local sensing of neighboring agents. We find that an attractive force makes tower building possible. Next, we explore the trade-offs between attraction and random motion to characterize the dynamics and phase transition of the tower building process. Lastly, we provide an optimization tool that may be used to design towers of specific shapes, mechanical loads, and dynamical properties, such as mechanical stability and mobility of the center of mass.}

ABSTRACT={The real world is highly variable and unpredictable, and so fine-tuned robot controllers that successfully result in group-level “emergence” of swarm capabilities indoors may quickly become inadequate outside. One response to unpredictability could be greater robot complexity and cost, but this seems counter to the “swarm philosophy” of deploying (very) large numbers of simple agents. Instead, here I argue that bioinspiration in swarm robotics has considerable untapped potential in relation to the phenomenon of phenotypic plasticity: when a genotype can produce a range of distinctive changes in organismal behavior, physiology and morphology in response to different environments. This commonly arises following a natural history of variable conditions; implying the need for more diverse and hazardous simulated environments in offline, pre-deployment optimization of swarms. This will generate—indicate the need for—plasticity. Biological plasticity is sometimes irreversible; yet this characteristic remains relevant in the context of minimal swarms, where robots may become mass-producible. Plasticity can be introduced through the greater use of adaptive threshold-based behaviors; more fundamentally, it can link to emerging technologies such as smart materials, which can adapt form and function to environmental conditions. Moreover, in social animals, individual heterogeneity is increasingly recognized as functional for the group. Phenotypic plasticity can provide meaningful diversity “for free” based on early, local sensory experience, contributing toward better collective decision-making and resistance against adversarial agents, for example. Nature has already solved the challenge of resilient self-organisation in the physical realm through phenotypic plasticity: swarm engineers can follow this lead.}

ABSTRACT={Many real-world applications have been suggested in the swarm robotics literature. However, there is a general lack of understanding of what needs to be done for robot swarms to be useful and trusted by users in reality. This paper aims to investigate user perception of robot swarms in the workplace, and inform design principles for the deployment of future swarms in real-world applications. Three qualitative studies with a total of 37 participants were done across three sectors: fire and rescue, storage organization, and bridge inspection. Each study examined the users' perceptions using focus groups and interviews. In this paper, we describe our findings regarding: the current processes and tools used in these professions and their main challenges; attitudes toward robot swarms assisting them; and the requirements that would encourage them to use robot swarms. We found that there was a generally positive reaction to robot swarms for information gathering and automation of simple processes. Furthermore, a human in the loop is preferred when it comes to decision making. Recommendations to increase trust and acceptance are related to transparency, accountability, safety, reliability, ease of maintenance, and ease of use. Finally, we found that mutual shaping, a methodology to create a bidirectional relationship between users and technology developers to incorporate societal choices in all stages of research and development, is a valid approach to increase knowledge and acceptance of swarm robotics. This paper contributes to the creation of such a culture of mutual shaping between researchers and users, toward increasing the chances of a successful deployment of robot swarms in the physical realm.}

ABSTRACT={Robot swarms are groups of robots that each act autonomously based on only local perception and coordination with neighboring robots. While current swarm implementations can be large in size (e.g., 1,000 robots), they are typically constrained to working in highly controlled indoor environments. Moreover, a common property of swarms is the underlying assumption that the robots act in close proximity of each other (e.g., 10 body lengths apart), and typically employ uninterrupted, situated, close-range communication for coordination. Many real world applications, including environmental monitoring and precision agriculture, however, require scalable groups of robots to act jointly over large distances (e.g., 1,000 body lengths), rendering the use of dense swarms impractical. Using a dense swarm for such applications would be invasive to the environment and unrealistic in terms of mission deployment, maintenance and post-mission recovery. To address this problem, we propose the sparse swarm concept, and illustrate its use in the context of four application scenarios. For one scenario, which requires a group of rovers to traverse, and monitor, a forest environment, we identify the challenges involved at all levels in developing a sparse swarm—from the hardware platform to communication-constrained coordination algorithms—and discuss potential solutions. We outline open questions of theoretical and practical nature, which we hope will bring the concept of sparse swarms to fruition.}

abstract={In multi-robot applications, such as foraging or collection tasks, interference, which results from competition for space between spatially extended robots, can significantly affect the performance of the group. We present a mathematical model of foraging in a homogeneous multi-robot system, with the goal of understanding quantitatively the effects of interference. We examine two foraging scenarios: a simplified collection task where the robots only collect objects, and a foraging task, where they find objects and deliver them to some pre-specified ``home'' location. In the first case we find that the overall group performance improves as the system size grows; however, interference causes this improvement to be sublinear, and as a result, each robot's individual performance decreases as the group size increases. We also examine the full foraging task where robots collect objects and deliver them home. We find an optimal group size that maximizes group performance. For larger group sizes, the group performance declines. However, again due to the effects of interference, the individual robot's performance is a monotonically decreasing function of the group size. We validate both models by comparing their predictions to results of sensor-based simulations in a multi-robot system and find good agreement between theory and simulations data.},

@book{VanKampen2007,
  abstract = {Of late there is an increasing interest in fluctuating phenomena and stochastic methods describing them, and the present book is an attempt to consolidate such efforts. The book consists of 14 chapters and can be conveniently divided into four parts. Part I consists of 1. Stochastic variables, 2. Random events, 3. Stochastic processes and 4. Markov processes; Part II comprises 5. The master equation, 6. One-step processes, 7. Chemical reactions, and 8. The Fokker-Planck equations and Langevin equations; Part III contains 9. The expansion of the master equation, 10. The diffusion type, and 11. Unstable systems; Part IV deals with diverse topics: 12. Fluctuation in continuous systems, 13. Statistics of jump events, and 14. Stochastic differential equations.

The earliest work on stochastic processes with special reference to problems of physical sciences dates back to 1943, namely, Chandrasekhar's classic review article. There were practically no books written in this flavour until the decade commencing from 1960, by which time the use of stochastic processes had become very popular. Many books have appeared in print since then. The book under review is distinctively different from the existing ones in content and more particularly in the basic approach. Part I covers material of a classical type; even there the approach is very stimulating and a graduate student, particularly in physics or chemistry, will profit enormously by studying the material and working out the problems indicated here and there. Parts II and III cover a good amount of the work of the author himself and it is here that even specialists in the subject will find it worthwhile to read through. The topics treated in Part IV take the reader to the very specialized areas in the frontier of research. Discussions of some topics like statistics of jump events and stochastic differential equations are rather incomplete. The author would have done well to bring them to the same level as the rest of the book. For instance, the use of stochastic calculi in modeling is a significant omission. Likewise, the statistics of jump events could have been improved to include a full discussion on the response phenomena.

On the whole the reviewer found the book most enjoyable and the book can be recommended to applied probabilists, physicists and physical chemists. The graduate student, especially the one who aspires to do modeling in physical sciences, will find the book very inspiring. },

In a two-dimensional biased random walk, the diffusion about the mean drift position is entirely dependent on the moments of the angular distribution used to determine the movement direction at each step. Here we consider biased random walks using several different angular distributions and derive expressions for the diffusion coefficients in each direction based on either a fixed or variable movement speed, and we use these to generate a probability density function for the long-time spatial distribution. We demonstrate how diffusion is typically anisotropic around the mean drift position and illustrate these theoretical results using computer simulations. We relate these results to earlier studies of swimming microorganisms and explain how the results can be generalized to other types of animal movement.},

A test-bed experiment is proposed in which the task of the robots is to pull sticks out of the ground---an action which requires the collaboration of two robots to be successful. The experiment is implemented in a physical setup composed of groups of 2 to 6 Khepera robots, and in Webots, a 3D simulator of Khepera robots.},

abstract = {In current robotics research there is a vast body of work on algorithms and control methods for groups of decentralized cooperating robots, called a swarm or collective. These algorithms are generally meant to control collectives of hundreds or even thousands of robots; however, for reasons of cost, time, or complexity, they are generally validated in simulation only, or on a group of a few tens of robots. To address this issue, this paper presents Kilobot, an open-source, low cost robot designed to make testing collective algorithms on hundreds or thousands of robots accessible to robotics researchers. To enable the possibility of large Kilobot collectives where the number of robots is an order of magnitude larger than the largest that exist today, each robot is made with only \$14 worth of parts and takes 5 min to assemble. Furthermore, the robot design allows a single user to easily operate a large Kilobot collective, such as programming, powering on, and charging all robots, which would be difficult or impossible to do with many existing robotic systems. We demonstrate the capabilities of the Kilobot as a collective robot, by using a small robot test collective to implement four popular swarm behaviors: foraging, formation control, phototaxis, and synchronization.}

abstract={A clear terminology is essential in every research discipline. In the context of ESOA, a lot of confusion exists about the meaning of the terms emergence and self-organisation. One of the sources of the confusion comes from the fact that a combination of both phenomena often occurs in dynamical systems. In this paper a historic overview of the use of each concept as well as a working definition, that is compatible with the historic and current meaning of the concepts, is given. Each definition is explained by supporting it with important characteristics found in the literature. We show that emergence and self-organisation each emphasise different properties of a system. Both phenomena can exist in isolation. The paper also outlines some examples of such systems and considers the combination of emergence and self-organisation as a promising approach in complex multi-agent systems.},

Designed following the natural laws of evolution, which merge self-organization and natural selection [1], these socially embedded information infrastructures can adapt to fulfill various needs as their environment demands. Computational intelligence techniques endow the AIIs with learning and discovery capabilities, emulating social and biological behavior. AIIs are destined to become an integral part of our life by supporting, rather than disturbing, a framework that facilitates strategic partnerships while providing greater user-friendliness, more efficient services support, user-empowerment, and support for human interactions.},

abstract="The building behaviour of termites has previously been modelled mathematically in two dimensions. However, physical and logistic constraints were not taken into account in these models. Here, we develop and test a three-dimensional agent-based model of this process that places realistic constraints on the diffusion of pheromones, the movement of termites, and the integrity of the architecture that they construct. The following scenarios are modelled: the use of a pheromone template in the construction of a simple royal chamber, the effect of wind on this process, and the construction of covered pathways. We consider the role of the third dimension and the effect of logistic constraints on termite behaviour and, reciprocally, the structures that they create. For instance, when agents find it difficult to reach some elevated or exterior areas of the growing structure, building proceeds at a reduced rate in these areas, ultimately influencing the range of termite-buildable architectures.",

abstract="Current implementations of decentralized multi-robot construction systems are limited to construction of rudimentary structures such as walls and clusters, or rely on the use of blueprints for regulation. Building processes that make use of blueprints are unattractive in unknown environments as they can not compensate for heterogeneities, such as irregular terrain. In nature, social insects coordinate the construction of their nests using stigmergy, a mechanism of indirect coordination that is robust and adaptive. In this paper, we propose the design of a multi-robot construction platform called the Swarm Robotics Construction System (SRoCS). The SRoCS platform is designed to leverage stigmergy in order to coordinate multi-robot construction in unknown environments.",
