* Thesis TODO [0%]
- [ ] Switch "graph richness" -> some sort of graph theory measure in AAMAS paper. Eigen centrality or closeness
centrality, cross-clique centrality look like they might be good, as long as the complex task decomposition graph has a higher value of whatever
measure is chosen.
- [ ] Switch from TAB -> something else in AAMAS paper content. I think TABs can be view as induced subgraphs/cliques of
some kind. I think you can compute TABs by merging all nodes in the 3-node cliques and then using THAT as the
graph/tree to switch between.
- [ ] Switch from neighborhood -> clique in AAMAS paper content. Much stronger graph theory basis.
- [ ] Switch are numbers in text to use the siunitx package (whatever the formatting is...)
