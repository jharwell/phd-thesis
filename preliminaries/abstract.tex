We investigate the emergence of swarm intelligence using task allocation in
large robot swarms. First, we compare task decomposition graphs of different
levels of richness and measure the emergent intelligence arising from
self-organized task allocation by deriving \gls{stoch-n1}, a stochastic allocation
algorithm which contextualizes per-robot task allocation decisions based on a
previous task's neighborhood within the graph. The results are compared to other
state of the art algorithms. Second, we derive \gls{mat-opt}: a greedy algorithm that
optimally solves the swarm task allocation problem by representing the swarm's
task allocation space as a matroid under some restrictive assumptions. We
compare the \gls{mat-opt} allocation method, which disregards task dependencies, with
\gls{stoch-n1}, which emphasizes collective learning of graph structure (including
dependencies). Results from an object gathering task show that swarm emergent
intelligence (1) is sensitive to the richness of task decomposition graphs (2)
is positively correlated with performance, (3) arises out of learning and
exploitation of graph connectivity and structure, rather than graph content.

We present a set of metrics intended to supplement designer intuitions when
designing swarm-robotic systems, increase accuracy in extrapolating swarm
behavior from algorithmic descriptions and small test experiments, and lead to
faster and less costly design cycles. We build on previous works studying
self-organizing behaviors in autonomous systems to derive a metric for swarm
emergent self-organization.  We utilize techniques from high performance
computing, time series analysis, and queueing theory to derive metrics for swarm
scalability, flexibility to changing external environments, and robustness to
internal system stimuli such as sensor and actuator noise and robot failures.

We demonstrate the utility of our metrics by analyzing four different control
algorithms in an indoor warehouse object transport scenario with static objects
and a spatially unconstrained outdoor search and rescue scenario with moving
objects. In the spatially constrained warehouse scenario, efficient use of space
is key to success so algorithms that use mechanisms for traffic regulation and
congestion reduction are the most appropriate.  In the search and rescue
scenario, the same will happen with algorithms which can cope well with object
motion through dynamic task allocation and randomized search trajectories. We
show that our intuitions about comparative algorithm performance are well
supported by the quantitative results obtained using our metrics, and that our
metrics can be synergistically used together to predict collective behaviors
based on previous results in some cases.
