  name={atomic task},
  %
  description={a task which cannot be decomposed into smaller, simpler tasks}
}

\newglossaryentry{task-partitioning} {
  %
  name={task partitioning},
  %
  description={the process of dividing a~\gls{decomposable-task} into simple
    subtasks which are multi-agent allocatable\cite{Ratnieks1999, Korsah2013}}

  %
  description={a task which has exactly one possible decomposition into
    a sequence of interdependent subtasks}
}

\newglossaryentry{swarm-engineering} {
  %
  name={swarm engineering},
  %
  description={a sub-field of SR system design which seeks to
    design systems which are based on rigorous mathematical methods but which
    also possess the desirable system properties of emergent self-organization,
    scalability, flexibility, and robustness
