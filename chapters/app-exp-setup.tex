\chapter{Experimental Setup}\label{app:exp-setup}

We use the ARGoS simulator~\cite{Pinciroli2012} with a dynamical physics model of
the marXbot (\cite{Dorigo2005c}) in a 3D space for maximum fidelity (robots are
still restricted to motion in the XY plane).

\section{Foraging Task Decomposition Graph}\label{exp-setup:sec:foraging-tdgraph}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{\figroot{appendix}/tdgraph-foraging.png}
  \phdcaption{Task decomposition graph for the foraging task}{The set of red and
    blue tasks correspond to a scheme in which robots do the whole task or 1/2
    task (single decomposition option, compound task decomposition graph).  The
    set of red and blue and green tasks correspond to a scheme in which robots
    do the whole task, 1/2 task, or 1/4 task (multi-decomposition option/complex
    task decomposition graph).  By decomposing the task into multiple parts,
    there are now task dependencies between the parts, which the swarm has to
    collectively learn.  Blue tasks ($\phi_i=1$) were defined
    in~\cite{Harwell2018} as a refinement of previous work, green tasks
    ($\phi_i=2$) were
    defined~\cite{Harwell2019a}.\label{exp-setup:fig:tdgraph-foraging}}
\end{figure}
%
We instantiate the task decomposition graph shown
in~\cref{exp-setup:fig:tdgraph-foraging} for the experiments
in~\cref{chap:RQ1,chap:RQ2}, extending previous
work~\cite{Harwell2018,Pini2011b,Ferrante2015} which explicitly or implicitly
defined the \emph{Forager},\emph{Harvester}, and \emph{Collector} tasks
($\phi_0$,$\phi_1$) which together comprised $\TAGraphV{a}$ (red and green
vertices), described below.
%
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Forager}: Acquire a free block of highest utility and bring it to
  the nest. This is $\TAGraphRoot$, and one way of accomplishing the swarm
  objective $\SwarmObjective$ via $\phi_0$.

\item \emph{Harvester}: Acquire a free block of highest utility and bring it to
  the existing cache of highest utility, calculated as:
  %
  \begin{equation}\label{exp-setup:eqn:existing-cache-utility}
    \mu_{\hat{C_j}}(t) = \frac{e^{-\tau_{\hat{C_j}}(t)}{\lvert \hat{C_j} \rvert}}{\norm{\ArbRobot - \mathbf{C_j}}\norm{\mathbf{C_j} - \mathbf{nest}}}
  \end{equation}
  %
  where $\lvert \hat{C_j} \rvert$ is the estimated size of the $j$th cache known
  to $\ArbRobot$ (caches might not exist anymore, and therefore a robot only has
  estimates of their existence). This equation emphasizes selection of caches
  that are close to the position of $\ArbRobot$, but also that are closer to the
  nest, while accounting for the relevancy of a robot's information about
  $C_j$~\cite{Harwell2018}. This task accomplishes part of $\SwarmObjective$ via
  $\phi_1$.

\item \emph{Collector} Acquire a block from the existing cache of highest
  utility (Eqn.~\eqref{exp-setup:eqn:existing-cache-utility}) and bring it to
  the nest. This task accomplishes part of $\SwarmObjective$ via $\phi_1$.
\end{itemize}
%
We extend prior work with the following tasks, implemented as vertices
comprising the task sequence $\phi_2$ (green vertices
in~\cref{exp-setup:fig:tdgraph-foraging}):

\begin{itemize}
\item {\emph{Cache Starter}: Acquire a free block of highest utility and bring
    it partway back to the nest, and then drop it at a feasible site to start a
    \emph{De Novo} cache, according to~\cref{exp-setup:eqn:cache-site-select}. A
    feasible site is one at least a distance $\eta$ from all known caches
    $\hat{C_1}\ldots\hat{C_n}$.
    %
    The best cache site \textbf{x} for $\ArbRobot$ is computed as follows:
    %
    \arraycolsep=0.75pt
    \begin{equation}
      \label{exp-setup:eqn:cache-site-select}
      \begin{array}{lc}
        \underset{\mathbf{x}}{\max} & \mu_{\ArbRobot} \\
        \text{s.t.} & \norm{\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{\hat{C_{m}}}} \geq \eta, \; m = 1, \ldots, n. \\
      \end{array}
    \end{equation}
    where
    \begin{equation}
      \label{exp-setup:eqn:cache-site-utility}
      \mu_{\ArbRobot} = {\Big(\norm{\mathbf{x} -\mathbf{x}_{\ArbRobot}} \norm{\mathbf{x} - \frac{\mathbf{x}_{\ArbRobot} - \mathbf{nest}}{2}}\Big)}^{-1} \\
    \end{equation}

    % [JRH] see if I can find some natural analogues of this sort of utility--would
    % really strengthen my choice of utility function
    Intuitively, cache sites that are close to $\mathbf{x}_{\ArbRobot}$ are
    better (less work to get to, less chance of being found unsuitable upon
    arrival), as are sites that are close to the halfway point between the
    robot's current position and the nest (bisecting the space maximizes
    available areas for \emph{Collector} and \emph{Harvester} tasks, reducing
    interference). This task accomplishes part of $\SwarmObjective$ via
    $\phi_2$.}

\item {\emph{Cache Finisher}: Acquire a free block of highest utility and place
    it within a distance $\eta$ to a \emph{De Novo} cache (a single free block a
    distance $\eta$ from all other blocks) of maximum utility
    (\cref{exp-setup:eqn:existing-cache-utility} with
    $\lvert\hat{C_j}\rvert = 1$) in order to create a new cache. This task
    accomplishes part of $\SwarmObjective$ via $\phi_2$.}

\item {\emph{Cache Transferer}: Acquire a block from the existing cache of
    highest utility and transport it to the existing cache with the second
    highest utility. This accomplishes part of $\SwarmObjective$ via $\phi_2$.
  }
\item {\emph{Cache Collector}: Acquire a block from the existing cache of
    highest utility (\cref{exp-setup:eqn:existing-cache-utility}) and bring it
    to the nest. This task accomplishes part of $\SwarmObjective$ via $\phi_2$.}
\end{itemize}
%
By defining $\phi_2$, we have also implicitly defined $\beta_1,\beta_2$.

\section{Foraging Algorithms}\label{exp-setup:sec:foraging-alg}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
We use the following foraging algorithms for the experiments investigating
~\gls{RQ1},~\gls{RQ2},~\gls{RQ3}.

\textbf{\gls{crw}}. Robots do a correlated random walk, which is a random walk
in which the direction of the motion at each step depends on the direction of
the previous step~\cite{Renshaw1981}, until they acquire an object, which they
then transport to the nest using phototaxis, i.e., motion in response to
light. Robots do not reallocate tasks, i.e., they always do the same task, and
have no memory (reactive algorithm). Similar controllers can be found
in~\cite{Lerman2001,Galstyan2005}.


\textbf{\gls{dpo}}.  Robots track objects they have seen using exponentially
decaying pheromones~\cite{Hecker2015,Harwell2020a}, and determine the ``best''
object to acquire using derived information relevance. Robots do not perform
dynamic task allocation (i.e., always perform the same task). Similar
controllers can be found in~\cite{Talamali2020}.

\textbf{\gls{stochm}}. Robots stochastically allocate tasks using
the~\gls{stochn1} algorithm~\cite{Harwell2020a}, a stochastic choice depending
on the location of the most recently executed task within the graph of tasks
available to each robot
(\cref{exp-setup:fig:tdgraph-foraging}). From~\cref{exp-setup:fig:tdgraph-foraging},~\gls{stochm}
robots can allocate any of the red or blue tasks, which are: (1) the entire
task, \emph{Forager}, retrieving an object and bringing it to the nest, (2) the
first half of the task, \emph{Harvester}, retrieving an object and bringing it
to a \emph{static} intermediate drop site (cache), or (3) the second half of the
task, \emph{Collector}, picking up a block from a cache and bringing it to the
nest.

\textbf{\gls{stochx}}. Robots also use the~\gls{stochn1} algorithm on the graph
in~\cref{exp-setup:fig:tdgraph-foraging}. However, they can now choose red,
'blue, or green tasks, i.e., they can exploit existing caches \emph{and} perform
tasks related to dynamically creating new caches. The new available tasks are:
placing a block somewhere to start a new cache, \emph{Cache Starter}, placing a
block next to a started cache to finish creating it, \emph{Cache Finisher},
transferring a block between two caches, making progress towards the nest,
\emph{Cache Transferer}, and picking up a block from a cache and bringing it to
the nest, \emph{Cache Collector}. A similar algorithm for mobile caches was
developed in~\cite{Lu2020}.
