Previous work in swarm engineering can be broadly classified into two
overlapping categories: automatic robot controller
synthesis~\cite{Francesca2014} which may guarantee collective behaviors and

system
properties~\cite{Winfield2005,Campo2007,Turgut2008,Correll2008,Moarref2018},
and the use of mathematical techniques to analyze and predict the collective
behavior of swarms from characteristics of individual robot
controllers~\cite{Talamali2020,Lerman2006,Berman2007}.

A method for optimal foraging, as defined from a biological perspective, was
presented in~\cite{Talamali2020} based on pheromone trails. Differential
equations were used to model the collective behavior of reactive
robots~\cite{Lerman2001} and robots with memory which perform task
allocation~\cite{Lerman2006}. Evolutionary techniques have also been used, and
the resulting controllers shown to be capable of successfully crossing the
simulation-reality gap~\cite{Francesca2014,Ligot2020}; other
works~\cite{Hogg2020} have evolved swarm supervisors (e.g., replacements for
human supervisors).

Controller synthesis via combined Lyapunov functions and control theoretic
techniques can provide guarantees that the resulting swarm is ``safe'' (i.e.,
stay in a desired set of states) in problems such as area patrol, autonomous
driving, and robot
walking~\cite{Panagou2020,Glotfelter2019,Ames2021}. Similarly, ensemble dynamics
filtering has been used to provably shape swarm dynamics during search and
rescue~\cite{Hsieh2013}. Temporal logic has been used as an alternative basis
for controller synthesis in scenarios where the results of robot actions are not
immediately observable~\cite{Winfield2005,Moarref2018} (e.g., robot motion
between spatial locations), for identifying unrealizable controllers and
analyzing synthesizer output~\cite{Baumeister2020}, and automated suggestion to
make unrealizable controllers realizable~\cite{Pacheck2020}. For a review of
recent works and issues in controller synthesis, see~\cite{Birattari2019}.
